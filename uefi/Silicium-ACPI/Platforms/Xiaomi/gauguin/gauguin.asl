/*
 * gauguin (SM7225) DSDT for the Windows-on-ARM port.
 *
 * This is the only ACPI table the platform has to author. APIC, FACP and GTDT
 * come from Silicon/Qualcomm/Moorea unmodified, because every value they carry
 * is SoC geometry and all of it was checked against gauguin's own device tree -
 * see docs/07-uefi-platform.md, "which SoC's ACPI tables gauguin can use".
 *
 * The device nodes below are the Bitra-family form, taken from
 * Platforms/Realme/bitra/DSDT.aml, with each load-bearing value re-checked
 * against Resources/DTBs/gauguin.dts rather than inherited:
 *
 *   UFS0 window      0x01D84000 + 0x14000   dts ufshc std 0x1D84000 + ice 0x1D90000
 *   UFS0 interrupt   297 (0x129)            dts SPI 265, and INTID = 32 + 265
 *   URS0 window      0x0A600000 + 0xFFFFF   dts dwc3 core 0xA600000, wrapper 0xA6F8800
 *   USB core irq     165 (0xA5)             dts usb@a600000  SPI 133, INTID = 32 + 133
 *   USB pwr_event    162 (0xA2)             dts interrupts-extended  SPI 130
 *   USB hs_phy_irq   163 (0xA3)             dts interrupts-extended  SPI 131
 *   QGP0 window      0x00804000 + 0x50000   dts gpi-dma@800000 0x800000 + 0x60000, "gpi-top"
 *   QGP0 interrupt   276 (0x114)            dts interrupts <0x00 0xF4 0x04>, INTID = 32 + 244
 *   QGP1 window      0x00904000 + 0x50000   dts gpi-dma@900000 0x900000 + 0x60000, "gpi-top"
 *   QGP1 interrupt   677 (0x2A5)            dts interrupts <0x00 0x285 0x04>, INTID = 32 + 645
 *   MMU0 window      0x15000000 + 0x100000   dts apps-smmu@15000000 0x15000000 + 0x100000
 *   MMU0 interrupts  97, 127-150, 213-224, 347-377, 433-445   dts 81 SPIs, INTID = 32 + SPI
 *   MMU1 window      0x03D40000 + 0x20000    dts arm,smmu-kgsl@3d40000 base, family length
 *   MMU1 interrupts  261, 263, 396-403       dts 10 SPIs, INTID = 32 + SPI
 *
 * One id was inherited rather than checked, and Step 4.65 corrected it. URS0's
 * _HID read "QCOM0497" for several steps - bitra's, and bitra is family 04,
 * while gauguin is 0A and both of that family's tables say "QCOM0A8B". It was
 * invisible because the URS index moves with the generator group and 0497 sits
 * inside the same plausible-looking QCOM range. The node comment below carries
 * the three angles it was re-derived from. UFS0's QCOM24A5 is the contrast and
 * is correct: it is 19 of 19 tables across every family, so the driver set not
 * claiming it is the set's gap rather than this file's error.
 *
 * Three interrupts bitra's node also carries were left out of this table until
 * Step 4.62, as GSIs 526, 527 and 529: the dts reaches them through the PDC
 * (phandle 0x62) on pins 14, 15 and 17, and they are the dp_hs / dm_hs / ss PHY
 * wake lines. They were omitted because their GSI encoding was undetermined.
 * Two readings were on the table and both fit: 512 + pin, and "the INTID the
 * PDC maps the pin to" - 480 + pin, here 494/495/497.
 *
 * The device tree answers it, and the answer is 512 + pin:
 *
 *   qcom,pdc-ranges = <0x00 0x1E0 0x5E  0x5E 0x261 0x1F  0x7D 0x3F 0x01 ...>
 *
 * is a list of <first pin, GIC SPI, count> triples, so its first entry reads
 * "pins 0..93 map to SPI 480..573" - pins 14, 15 and 17 all fall in it. The dts
 * then names those three pins on the wake lines-
 *
 *   usb@a6f8800 interrupts-extended = <0x01 0x00 0x82 0x04  0x01 0x00 0x83 0x04
 *                                       0x62 0x0e 0x03  0x62 0x0f 0x03
 *                                       0x62 0x11 0x04>
 *   interrupt-names               = "pwr_event", "hs_phy_irq", "dp_hs_phy_irq",
 *                                   "dm_hs_phy_irq", "ss_phy_irq"
 *
 * - so dp_hs is pin 14, dm_hs pin 15 and ss pin 17, and INTID = 32 + SPI gives
 * 526, 527 and 529. The 480 + pin reading had stopped one step short: 480 + pin
 * is a GIC SPI number, and an ACPI Interrupt () resource carries the INTID.
 * That is the same slip the UFS pair above documents, on a different number.
 *
 * Two more things agree, and all three are independent. bitra - the same SM7225
 * line, and the source of this file's form - carries exactly 0x20E, 0x20F and
 * 0x211 in its USB0 _CRS, with Edge, Edge and Level triggers matching the type
 * cells 3, 3 and 4 the dts gives above. And 21 of the 66 tables in
 * Silicium-ACPI have a PM0x node at all; all 21 carry 0x201 = 513 for it, which
 * is the same arithmetic on the SPMI arbiter's own PDC pin 1 - gauguin's
 * spmi@c440000 says interrupts-extended = <0x62 0x01 0x04>. The trigger types
 * and the listing order below are bitra's, since it is the closest table that a
 * shipped Windows driver already binds.
 *
 * See the "USB PHY wake interrupts" note in docs/07-uefi-platform.md.
 *
 * That slip has now happened a third time, and Step 4.253 caught it by measuring
 * the file against the device tree instead of against itself. The three CSI
 * bridges were written in Step 4.250 with the *SPI* number where the GSI belongs:
 *
 *   CSID   dts qcom,csid0@acb3000 interrupts <0x00 0x1D0 0x01>   wrote 0x1D0
 *   CSI1   dts qcom,csid1@acba000 interrupts <0x00 0x1D2 0x01>   wrote 0x1D2
 *   CSI2   dts qcom,csid2@acc1000 interrupts <0x00 0x2CD 0x01>   wrote 0x2CD
 *
 * and the correct values are 0x1F0, 0x1F2 and 0x2ED. The fourth camera node in
 * the same step, VFE0, took dts SPI 0x1D1 and wrote 0x1F1 - correctly - which is
 * what makes this a slip and not a deliberate encoding: three siblings out of
 * four obeyed the rule stated at the top of this comment block, and the raw SPI
 * is therefore not an alternative reading of the same hardware. It is also the
 * one class of error none of the existing gates can see: `iasl` compiles it, the
 * generated twin is `cmp`-identical to it, `acpiexec` loads and runs it, and
 * tools/acpi-runtime-check.py passes it, because every one of those reads this
 * file for its expectation. A bridge handed a GSI 32 below its real interrupt
 * never fires, and nothing in the pipeline would have said so. The check that
 * did catch it - every `Interrupt ()` in this file against the live device
 * tree's own `interrupts` cell - is now tools/acpi-dt-crosscheck.py.
 *
 * The CPU devices are Moorea's Silicon/Qualcomm/Moorea/DSDT_Minimal.asl: eight
 * ACPI0007 processors with _UID 0-7, matching the Processor UID and MPIDR that
 * Moorea's APIC GICC entries carry (0x0, 0x100 ... 0x700), which is what
 * gauguin's device tree states too. No _LPI: gauguin's low-power idle
 * parameters have not been derived, and an unverified _LPI is worse than none.
 *
 * P3's first item also asks for I2C, SPI, buttons and thermal zones, and half
 * of that list is here. Here: the I2C engines - the QUP pair I2C8 and I2C9 and
 * the charger cluster's IC11, Steps 4.68 through 4.87 - and the generic button
 * device BTNS, Step 4.89. Not here: the SPI engines, written when a slave with
 * a driver arrives rather than on their own, and the thermal zones, which are a
 * step of their own. The PMIC family - SPMI, PMIC and PM01, Step 4.63 - the
 * TLMM pin controller, GIO0, and its pin count, Step 4.64 and 4.65 - and the
 * Type-C controller UCS0 came earlier and stay, because unlike the others their
 * names turned out not to be a guess. The note above each node is how that
 * node's values were settled.
 *
 * UCS0 is the first node added here on the strength of the driver set's own
 * claim rather than of a sibling table: qcusbcucsi7280.inf binds
 * `ACPI\QCOM0AA4` by name, so the id is confirmed twice over - once by the
 * pinned set and once by lisa and a52sxq. PEP0, which UCS0 and URS0 both
 * depend on in lisa's table, is deliberately not ported with it; that node's
 * comment carries the measurement and the reason.
 *
 * What stays out stays out for a measured reason. Every one of those nodes
 * needs a `_HID`, and the device tree carries no ACPI name: it has registers
 * and pins, which are the half that is knowable. I2C is the case that showed
 * the way through rather than the exception to it - its id is not read off the
 * tree either, it is read off the family, and qci2c7280.inf claims it.
 *
 * The PM01 census is what changed the picture, and it is worth stating in full.
 * Across the 21 platforms in Silicium-ACPI that carry a PMIC-GPIO node at all -
 * 22 files, Kailua being the one platform with two, DSDT_MTP and DSDT_QRD - one
 * block, one function, every one of them with the same interrupt at 0x201 and
 * the same `_UID One` - the `_HID` takes nine different values, and the middle
 * byte is the SoC family and nothing else:
 *
 *   QCOM0269  02  caymanslm         QCOM1430  14  surya
 *   QCOM0530  05  mh2 cepheus       QCOM1A2D  1A  lemonade venus
 *                 nabu pipa vayu                   vili Lahaina
 *   QCOM0830  08  a52q miatoll      QCOM252D  25  alioth
 *   QCOM092D  09  renoir Cedros     QCOM0C2D  0C  Kailua Waipio
 *   QCOM0A2D  0A  lisa a52sxq
 *
 * gauguin's family byte is 0A, and that is measured rather than chosen: the
 * SC7280/Kodiak Windows driver set names 8 of gauguin's 10 blocks under it and 0
 * of 10 under every other byte. So this file's PMIC-GPIO node is `QCOM0A2D`, and
 * qcpmicgpio7280.inf claims exactly that. The same byte settles the TLMM block
 * that is still outstanding: the TLMM window 0xF100000 is QCOM1A0C on vili and
 * lemonade, QCOM0A0C on lisa and a52sxq, QCOM250C on alioth and QCOM090C on
 * renoir - and the 7280 set claims QCOM0A0C, for qcgpio7280.inf.
 *
 * So the earlier reading of this file's own header was half wrong. The choice of
 * `_HID` here is not free and not arbitrary; it is patterned, and the byte that
 * patterns it is the same byte that decides which driver set binds. Copying a
 * name from a table on another family is therefore not merely unverified, it is
 * predictably wrong.
 *
 * The consequence of getting it wrong is specific and bad. A node whose `_HID`
 * no driver claims does not fail, warn or fall back; it is absent from Device
 * Manager and the hardware behind it is simply not there. That is worse than a
 * missing node, which at least reads as missing. So every id added below was
 * checked against the driver set first - tools/acpi-hid-census.py
 * --drivers DIR --bind ID does exactly that and exits 1 on an unclaimed QCOM id.
 * Run it before adding any node here.

        // SDC1=QCOM24BF and SDC2=QCOM2466 is read off a same-family table at the

        // The GSI convention is measured rather than assumed, from the four

        // 354 -> 0x182 = 386; I2C9 is 355 -> 0x183 = 387; IC11 is 357 -> 0x185
        // = 389. So SDC2's hc_irq at DT 204 is 236 = 0xEC, and SDC1's at DT 641
        // is 673 = 0x2A1. Both devices declare a second interrupt, pwr_irq (DT
        // 222 -> 254 and DT 644 -> 676), which is not declared here for the same
        // reason it is not declared on UFS0 or on renoir's pair: the family's
        // _CRS gives the data interrupt alone.
        //
        // SDC1's _STA returns Zero, and that is a decision rather than an
        // omission. renoir does not decide its pair the same way - its SDC1
        // returns 0x0F only when STOR == 0x02 - so presence there is a board
        // variable that is set for the variant that has the eMMC. gauguin's
        // tables carry no such variable, and this port cannot invent one: on a
        // UFS unit an eMMC controller reporting present is exactly the
        // device-that-does-not-start the header warns about, so the node is
        // written inert and the one byte that turns it on is obvious to whoever
        // finds a unit with the eMMC fitted. renoir itself does this to its own
        // SDC2, whose _STA returns Zero unconditionally.
        //
        // Withheld, and this one is a diagnostic budget rather than a hardware
        // question: both of renoir's nodes also carry an empty _DIS, which
        // pairs with an _SRS their generator does not emit, and iasl answers

        // (`soc/interrupt-controller@17a00000`, reg 0x17A00000 + 0x10000 and
        // 0x17A60000 + 0x100000), and gauguin's icnss declares 12 interrupts
        // where lisa's QWLN declares 32. So QWLN is not written, and the reason
        // that costs nothing is worth recording: **lisa's QWLN carries no
        // `_HID` at all** - it is `_ADR Zero`, a `_DEP` of PEP0/MMU0/IPC0,
        // `_PRW`, `_S0W`/`_S4W`, a `_PRR` pointing at its own `WRST` power
        // resource, and the `_CRS` above, and nothing else. What actually binds
        // the wireless device is not an ACPI node: qcsubsys_ext_wpss7280.inf's
        // `[WPSS_Children]` section tells the qcsubsys driver to create the

        // no INF in the set claims an `ACPI\` id for WLAN anywhere. The child's
        // `_HID` is a driver registry value, so a firmware node cannot supply

        // SMMUs. A guess cannot exceed the driver's own singleton, while a
        // re-addressing step can still split the node later if the driver turns
        // out to be multi-instance. `qcdx7280.inf`'s `QCOM0A36` variants, which
        // key on `&REV_`, are the counter-example and the reason this had to be

        // in the open rather than as fact: 4.249 left "what `_UID`s the extra
        // CSIDs take" undecided, and it is still undecided - the three write
        // 0x21, 0x22 and 0x23, all three above the corpus's highest camera
        // `_UID` (0x1E) and none of them a number this file or the corpus uses

        // Consecutive values in a range nobody has claimed say "this is where
        // the extras went" and do not borrow another node's identity to say it.
        //
        // The three are written with no `_STA`, which is lisa's own shape for
        // `CCID` and is a decision rather than a copy: `qcccidbridge7280.sys` is
        // a KMDF *bus* driver (Class System, `KmdfService = CCIDBridge`), so a
        // node carrying this id enumerates children that this file does not
        // describe. `_STA` returning 0x0F would report a functioning bridge with
        // an empty bus; omitting `_STA` lets the device fall to the OS default,
        // which is how such a node is meant to look. **(Step 4.251 measured
        // what that default is and it is not what the sentence above first
        // claimed. `acpiexec` reports `AE_NOT_FOUND` for `\_SB.CSID._STA`,
        // `\_SB.CSI1._STA` and `\_SB.CSI2._STA`: the *namespace* carries no
        // statement about the three. The OS's rule in the absence of `_STA` is

        //   of their own, three of them declaring no device at all. The claim
        //   is true of the ABD family and was written as true of the corpus -
        //   the same mistake the QUP protocol counts below were making in the
        //   same step, and the reason `tools/acpi-dep-census.py` now exists to
        //   be asked again: `--carrier ABD SCM0` is the reading that says which
        //   family a sentence like this one is about.
        //
        //   A correction, because the comment above the SMMUs gives that rule
        //   a justification that is not true. It says "a one-entry _DEP is a
        //   shape no table has". ABD's is one entry in 19 tables, and PRTC's is
        //   one entry naming \_SB.PMAP. The shape is common; what makes an
        //   entry un-writable is that it names a node this table has not got.
        //   The rule lands in the same place either way and the reason does
        //   not, and a reason that is wrong is worse than a short one.
        //
        // _STA is written, returning 0x0F, because the two corpus tables that
        // carry one both return 0x0F while the nineteen that omit it are
        // present by ACPI's default - so the two forms describe the same
        // device, and this file's convention on the devices it defines is to
        // say it outright.
        //
        // ROP1 is not private to PEP0, which is the part worth knowing before
        // the clients arrive. The address in each client's Connection is a
        // channel, and the corpus is consistent about which device owns which.
        // All 53 fields in the corpus, measured by channel:
        //
        //   0x0001  PEP0   AttribRawBytes (0x15)  FLD0, 168 bits  (18 tables)
        //   0x0001  PEP0   AttribRawBytes (0x1A)  FLD1,  40 bits  (both Kailua)
        //   0x0002  PRTC   AttribRawBytes (0x18)  FLD0, 192 bits  (19 tables)
        //   0x0003  PMGK   AttribRawBytes (0x30)  UCSI, 384 bits  (11 tables)
        //   0x0004  PMGK   AttribRawBytes (0x40)  GOEM, 512 bits  (Kailua x2, Waipio)
        //
        // Two things in that table are corrections to what this comment said
        // before Step 4.78 measured all 53 fields instead of the sixteen it had
        // read. The field name is the client's own and is not always FLD0: PMGK
        // names its two channels UCSI and GOEM, and UCSI is a name that means
        // something - the USB Type-C Connector System Software Interface - so
        // the name is data and not a formality. And Kailua's odd entry is odder
        // than it looked: it is not 0x15 spelled as 0x1A on the same field, it
        // is a different field - FLD1 at 40 bits where the other 18 tables
        // declare FLD0 at 168 - so Kailua's PEP0 reads a fifth of the payload
        // from the same channel, and asks the bus for 26 bytes to get it. Both
        // halves are recorded rather than resolved: PEP0 is not written yet, and
        // when it is, 0x15 with FLD0 at 168 bits is this board's declaration, on
        // the rule that the field's length is the one number of the two with a
        // reason behind it.
        //
        // PRTC is the one that matters most, and it is a device Windows already
        // has a driver for: its _HID is ACPI000E, the standard Time and Alarm
        // Device, and its _GRT and _SRT read and write the real time over
        // channel 0x0002. All 20 corpus PRTCs carry that _HID, and every one of
        // them carries a one-entry _DEP naming \_SB.PMAP - 19 as the string
        // "\\_SB.PMAP" and one, Waipio, as the path - so PMAP was PRTC's only
        // dependency. Step 4.77 wrote PMAP, which made that entry writable, and
        // Step 4.78 wrote PRTC on it. The spelling was settled by counting every
        // _DEP entry in the corpus rather than the twenty here, and the count
        // inverts the vote: 1,416 packages hold 3,058 entries, 3,039 of them are
        // name references and 19 are strings, and the 19 strings are these. So
        // the form 19 tables prefer is a form no other device in the corpus uses,
        // and Waipio's is the form the other 65 tables use. See the PRTC node.
        // Of the other two clients, PMGK is QCOM0A8E and no .inf in this set
        // claims it, and PEP0 is the remaining large node.
        //
        // Position, which in this file is now a derivation rather than a copy.
        // ABD stood near the end until Step 4.78 and that was wrong in a way the
        // compiler caught: PRTC's Field names \_SB.ABD.ROP1, a Field cannot
        // reference an OperationRegion that has not been declared yet, and iasl
        // rejected it as Error 6142, illegal forward reference. The rule is
        // ACPI's and not the compiler's - the namespace is built in declaration
        // order, so the region has to exist before the field is created - and it
        // is why the corpus's own order is load-bearing rather than stylistic:
        // ABD precedes PRTC in all 20 tables that carry both, as it precedes
        // PMAP, and its position is measured too. It is immediately followed by
        // PMIC in all 21 tables, and immediately preceded by SDC2 in 18 of them
        // and UFS0 in the other 3, which puts it third, fourth or fifth in every
        // table. THIS file has no SDC1 or SDC2 node, which leaves UFS0 as the
        // node it follows, and Step 4.88 - the reordering to the corpus's own
        // order - moved it to exactly there: immediately after UFS0, the slot the
        // 3 tables without an SDC2 use, and immediately before PMIC, where all 21
        // put it. Between Steps 4.78 and 4.87 the node stood between SPMI and
        // PMIC, which was the same adjacency read against this file's then-current
        // SPMI slot; SPMI was itself one of the eight units 4.88 moved, to its own
        // slot after SCM0, and the two readings agree about PMIC. The run
        // continues in the corpus's own order behind it: PMIC, then PML0, then
        // PM01 - PML0 sits between the two in 11 of the 21 tables that carry
        // PMIC, and this file became one of the 11 in Step 4.79, which is why the
        // node is here and not further down the file - then PMAP, then PRTC, and
        // PM01 -> PMAP -> PRTC is unbroken in 20 of 20.

        // AVBL is read by nothing in this table, and could not be: in the

        // this tree generates as s136 and s137 - so the vendor's name for the
        // PM8008's two register windows is its two addresses, 8 and 9.
        //
        // gauguin carries one part. Its tree holds exactly one pm8008, the only
        // child of i2c@990000, and it answers at 0x08:
        //
        //   pmic@8 { compatible = "qcom,pm8008"; reg = <0x08>; ... }
        //
        // So Leica 1 is present, Leica 2 is not, and _CRS carries 0x08 and 0x09

        // part and this is not one, which is the same reading as the bitmap: 0b01.
        //
        // The bus is IC11 and the pins are GIO0's, both from that same board
        // reading. i2c@990000 has reg = <0x990000 0x4000>, and this table's IC11

        // is 11 by the global numbering Step 4.87 applied. The corpus names its
        // bus in this same cell - lisa \_SB.I2C2, lemonade and renoir \_SB.IC14, a52q
        // \_SB.IC10 - so the source string is the one cell of the corpus's _CRS a
        // port must change, and the address cells do not move. The pins are the
        // board's as well: reset-gpios is <&tlmm 0x3a 1> and interrupts-extended
        // is <&tlmm 0x3b 1>, and pm8008-default-state names those two pins as
        // gpio58 (reset-n) and gpio59 (int). TLMM in this table is GIO0, QCOM0A0C
        // at 0x0F100000 + 0x300000, so both pins name \_SB.GIO0 - as they do in
        // six of the eleven tables. The other four put them on \_SB.PM01, which is
        // the PMIC's own GPIO block and not this board's wiring.
        //
        // Which pin is which is written nowhere in the corpus: the GpioIo
        // parameters are byte-identical across all eleven tables and none of them
        // is named. So the order here is this file's, and it is the majority's -
        // nine of the eleven tables list two pins and seven list them ascending,
        // while both Kailua tables list 0x00A1 before 0x002A. gauguin's two are
        // 0x3A and 0x3B in ascending order, which is also reset before interrupt.
        // One note against reading lisa or a52sxq as the two-pin example: there
        // the second pin appears only in the branch that also adds Leica 2's
        // addresses, so in those two tables it belongs to the second part.
        // gauguin has one part with two pins, so the pin list is the board's.
        //
        // The GpioIo parameters do transfer and are copied exactly - Exclusive,
        // PullNone, 0x0000, 0x00C8, IoRestrictionNone - and so is the 0x000186A0
        // in each connection. That number is the slave's declared speed, 100 kHz,
        // and the corpus writes it in all nine tables that carry an I2C entry.
        // gauguin's controller runs at 0x00061A80, 400 kHz, and that is a
        // property of i2c@990000 rather than of the part; the corpus's number is
        // the vendor's for this part and is the slower of the two, so it is the
        // one written.
        //
        // _STA is 0x0B and it is a board answer and not a family one. The corpus
        // splits seven Zero to four 0x0B, and the split cuts through the id: lisa
        // and a52sxq both declare QCOM0AD3 and return 0x0B and Zero respectively,
        // so the same driver on the same part is hidden on one board and not on
        // the other. gauguin's part is populated and is used - the tree's
        // pm8008-thermal zone takes this node's phandle as its thermal-sensors -
        // and 0x0B is present and enabled without the UI presence bit. Zero would
        // tell Windows the part is not there, which on this board would leave the
        // driver that owns it unbound.
        //
        // No _UID, no _STR and no _CCA: all eleven tables omit all three, and the
        // device is a single instance. _SUB is the corpus's \_SB.PSUB in nine of
        // the eleven - lisa and a52sxq are the two that define a method, for the
        // SKU branching their _CRS does - so it is Alias (^PSUB, _SUB), which is
        // this file's spelling of it from depth 1. _DEP is the bus and one entry,
        // as in all nine I2C tables; Kailua's PML0 has no _DEP because it has no
        // I2C entry to depend on. And the position is measured rather than
        // stylistic: PML0 is immediately preceded by PMIC and immediately followed

        //   QCOM252C  1   alioth
        //
        // and exactly one of the nine is claimed by the shipped driver set -

        // at the top of this comment:
        //
        //   %DeviceDesc%=PMIC_Inst,ACPI\QCOM0A2C
        //   %DeviceDesc%=PMIC_Inst,ACPI\VEN_QCOM&DEV_0A2C
        //
        // The check this time is stronger than the one Steps 4.75 and 4.76
        // used: those read the loose inf tree, and this one extracted all 112
        // .inf files from the 112 .cab files of the 7280 driver set and
        // grepped each id in all of them. QCOM04DD comes back qcscm.inf and
        // QCOM0427 qcabd.inf, which re-derives both of those decisions by the
        // same route, and the other eight PMAP ids come back unclaimed.
        //
        // Here, and for the first time, the two witnesses agree. QCOM0A2C is
        // family 0A, gauguin's own family, and the two tables that write it -
        // lisa and a52sxq - are the pair every other PMIC-family decision in
        // this file has been taken from. ABD was decided on the family alone
        // and SCM0 on the driver's spelling alone, each against the corpus
        // majority; PMAP is the first node where the claimed id and the family
        // id are the same id. The a52q table, which has been the
        // counterexample twice, is one here too: it is SM7225, the same SoC as
        // gauguin, and it writes QCOM082F, one of the eight ids nothing
        // claims. Same SoC, wrong family byte, the same finding as on the
        // thermal zones and on SCM0.
        //
        // Where it goes. PMAP immediately follows PM01 in all 20 tables.
        // Whether any other node's position is invariant in that way has not
        // been measured; this one was, so this one is taken.
        //
        // The shape is uniform. All 20 carry exactly these members, in this
        // order - _HID, the _SUB alias, _DEP, _STA in the four that have it,
        // GEPT, _CRS - with one node's worth of variation and it is Waipio's:
        // it drops _CRS, makes _SUB a method rather than an alias, and keeps
        // an explicit _STA of 0x0F. No PMAP in the corpus carries a _UID, and
        // this one needs none: its id is unique here, so there is nothing to
        // disambiguate.
        //
        // GEPT is not PMAP's own. The same method, spelled the same way, is on
        // two other nodes across the corpus, and the only difference between
        // the three is the constant returned:
        //
        //   PMAP.GEPT   0x02   in 20 declarations, all identical
        //   PEP0.GEPT   One    in 20 declarations, all identical
        //   PMGK.GEPT   0x03   in 10 declarations, and an eleventh that is
        //                      not: Waipio's returns Buffer (0x03)
        //                      { 0x03, 0x04, 0x06 } through a different body
        //
        // so PMAP's and PEP0's are uniform across their whole families and
        // PMGK's is not, and the table that breaks it is Waipio - the same
        // table that is the exception on PMAP itself, on ABD, and on SCM0.
        // PMAP's is the only one of the three this file can write today: PEP0
        // is the largest node still to come and PMGK is one nothing in the
        // driver set claims, and both are absent. The other two belong beside
        // those nodes.
        //
        // Nothing calls GEPT. Outside each node's own declaration the name
        // occurs in no table - the only other lines are the reference comments
        // iasl writes back on the Return it annotates. So the caller is not
        // ASL, and whether the driver evaluates it was tested rather than
        // assumed: the test is the one that established OFNI on GIO0, and it
        // fails here. qcpmicapps7280.sys has no four-character uppercase run
        // that can be an ACPI method name. Its runs of that form are RSDS,
        // PAGE, NULL, INIT, GCTL and DITM - a debug directory signature,
        // section names, and two that name nothing in any of the 66 tables;
        // GCTL is in qcgpio.sys as well, which is what a shared compiler
        // artefact looks like and a method name does not. GEPT occurs once,
        // inside the eight-byte run AeiBGEPT, which is what a compiler makes
        // of the adjacent literals "AeiB" and "GEPT"; the same image carries
        // AeoB, qcgpio.sys carries AeiA and AeoB with OFNI standing alone, and
        // qcabd.sys carries AeiBSSID - SSID being a name in none of the 66
        // tables either. The glued form does not name methods, whatever else
        // it is, so no claim is made from it in either direction. GEPT is here
        // because all 20 corpus PMAP nodes carry it, identically.
        //
        // STAT, inside it, is created and then never written or read: the
        // method returns the word at offset 2 and byte 0 stays zero. It is a
        // leftover of the generator's shape and it is carried, because
        // dropping it would be an AML difference from the reference that buys
        // nothing.
        //
        // _STA returning 0x0F is this file's convention on every device it
        // defines, and here the corpus agrees by default rather than by vote:
        // 16 of the 20 leave _STA out entirely, which the specification reads
        // as present, enabled, shown and working - the same four bits - and a
        // seventeenth, Waipio, writes 0x0F outright. The three that write
        // something else write 0x0B, which clears the UI bit and so hides the

        // a52q, miatoll and surya: families 08, 08 and 14, the pre-0A
        // families, with no 0A table among them. gauguin is 0A. If this device

        // immediately by PRTC in all 20 tables that carry both, and PRTC is
        // immediately preceded by PMAP in all 20, so PM01 -> PMAP -> PRTC is a
        // three-node run and this node goes directly after PMAP. What follows
        // PRTC is not fixed - PMBM in 10 tables, PEXT in 6, BAT1 in 2, PMBT and
        // PMGK in 1 each - so the run has an end and the corpus says where it is.
        //
        // The Field is the device's only resource and it is declared on
        // \_SB.ABD.ROP1, which is why ABD is written: PRTC has no _CRS in any of
        // the 20 tables and no MMIO window, and reads its clock by opening a
        // field on ABD's GenericSerialBus operation region. The channel is
        // 0x0002, which is the same triple the ABD comment above records from
        // the producer's side - AttribRawBytes (0x18), FLD0 at 192 bits - and
        // the number in I2cSerialBusV2 is that same channel byte, so the channel
        // index is the slave address on the bus ABD presents. The resource
        // source is "\\_SB.ABD" itself, as in every client's Connection: this is
        // the family's one device that is a bus, which is what its driver's
        // description - "ACPI Bridge Device" - says it is.
        //
        // 19 of the 20 tables declare that field and the twentieth is the
        // exception that is not a variant. caymanslm's PRTC has no Field at all:
        // it reads and writes FLD0 as a bare name, which ACPI resolves outward
        // through \_SB.PRTC, then \_SB, then \ - and the only FLD0 in that table
        // is \_SB.PEP0.FLD0, declared on PEP0's channel. A field unit is not
        // reachable sideways, so that reference does not resolve, and the
        // disassembler says so: iasl emits External (FLD0, IntObj) at the top of
        // that table. A PRTC whose clock reads PEP0's channel data, and whose
        // _SRT stores a 50-byte buffer into a 168-bit field, is a broken
        // declaration and not a second shape. The effective corpus for this node
        // is therefore 19 tables, and all 19 are byte-identical inside the
        // device.
        //
        // _GRT and _SRT are the ACPI-defined read and write of the real time and
        // the arithmetic in them is the part worth reading before the sizes are
        // copied. _GRT builds a 26-byte local, lays a 16-byte TME1 at bit 0x10 -
        // byte 2 - and returns TME1, so bytes 2..17 of the buffer are the time
        // structure ACPI defines for _GRT and the first two bytes are the
        // channel's own status. The field is 24 bytes, so the local is two bytes
        // longer than the region it is filled from: BUFF = FLD0 stores 24 bytes
        // and leaves bytes 24 and 25 at zero, which is past the end of TME1 and
        // harmless. _SRT is 50 bytes for the same reason and one more: it stores
        // BUFF into FLD0 and then stores the result back into BUFF, chained as
        // BUFF = FLD0 = BUFF, and what the second store is for is the status the
        // bus writes into byte 0 on completion - the method then tests it and
        // returns One if it is non-zero. So the region is a write-then-readback
        // whose first byte is a reply code, which also explains why the 50-byte
        // local is allowed to be truncated to 24 on the way out: everything past
        // byte 23 is ACT1 and ACW1 tail, and both are set to zero immediately
        // before the store, so the truncation drops nothing that was not zero.
        //
        // _GCP returns 0x04, in all 20 tables, 19 as a method and Waipio as
        // Name (_GCP, 0x04). What bit 2 of that capability mask means is not
        // established here: ACPI000E's driver is the OS's own, nothing in the
        // 112 .inf files or the five driver trees mentions the method, and no
        // table comments it. One constraint does come out of the corpus and it
        // rules out the obvious reading - _GWS, _STW and _STV appear in none of
        // the 66 tables, so the alarm half of the device is implemented nowhere
        // and 0x04 cannot be advertising it. The value is copied and the decode
        // is recorded as open rather than guessed at.
        //
        // _STA returning 0x0F is this file's convention, and the corpus's answer
        // here is the same shape as PMAP's: 16 of the 20 leave the method out,
        // Waipio writes 0x0F, and the three that write 0x0B - present, enabled
        // and working, but not shown in Device Manager - are a52q, miatoll and
        // surya. Those are the same three tables that write 0x0B on PMAP, which
        // makes 0x0B a habit of those boards and not a statement about either
        // device: families 08, 08 and 14, the pre-0A families, and the same
        // table named as the counterexample in Steps 4.73, 4.76 and 4.77 among
        // them. gauguin's family is 0A and the method says 0x0F.
        //
        // No _UID and no _CRS, both because all 20 tables omit them. The device
        // has no resources of its own to describe - the Connection inside the
        // Field is the whole of its allocation - and nothing in the family needs
        // a second instance.

        // The ids. `_HID` is "QCOM0A17": the middle byte moves with the

        // management controller - carried by fourteen of the twenty, among them
        // both of the tables at this `_HID`; the other six carry no `_CID`.
        //
        // `_DEP` is `\_SB.IPCC`. Eleven of the twenty name it, three name
        // \_SB.PMIC, and six carry none. IPCC is the node this table already has
        // and the one whose own `_DEP` names PEP0 as the far end of its mailbox.

        // rather than on a set invented to fill it out: gauguin is an MTP board
        // and the id `_SUB` returns should be the one the board sets. The absent
        // fall-through is the corpus's own shape - no table returns anything
        // when no branch matches.

        // `_DSM` is written, and it is the member whose shape needed a decision.
        // The UUID is not in doubt: 8d5ca34c-ae83-4a2a-9dd1-a74ffead548b is
        // carried as a raw GUID at offset 1707616 of qcpep7280.sys, and the same
        // string is in every corpus table that has a PEP0 `_DSM`. What the
        // method does is report subsystem state: one selector returns the
        // subsystem list, and six selectors each ask `\_SB.ADSP._STA` and five
        // siblings for theirs. This table has none of those six devices - the two
        // DSPs, the sensor island, the modem and the two secure processors are
        // firmware on this board and not ACPI nodes - so the six are declared
        // `External` above and every read is behind `CondRefOf`, which is what
        // the corpus's own tables do: lisa's disassembly reads
        // `Return (\_SB.SCSS._STA)` and annotates it "External reference". Each
        // of the six selectors therefore answers Zero here, and the list below is
        // the family's.
        //
        // That list is six entries - adsp, slpi, cdsp, modem, spss, wpss - copied
        // from lisa verbatim, because lisa and a52sxq are the only two tables
        // that carry it and both are family 0A. It is not a claim about this
        // board, and the difference is worth being explicit about: the vendor
        // tree declares three remoteprocs - adsp at 0x03000000, modem's mpss at
        // 0x04080000, cdsp at 0x08300000 - and no slpi, spss or wpss node at
        // all. The list says which subsystems the driver should ask about; the
        // six selectors are what answer, and they answer Zero for the ones this
        // board has not got. The modem is the case that matters: mpss exists in
        // firmware and is declared in the tree, and it still cannot be driven
        // from Windows, which is why the table has no AMSS node to answer for it.
        //
        // `_CRS` is eleven GSIs, and the set is a function of the `_HID` family
        // byte rather than of the SoC: every QCOM0A17 table writes these eleven
        // in this order, QCOM0819 writes nine, QCOM0C17 ten of a different set,
        // and QCOM1A17 four tables that disagree among themselves. The first
        // four are derived from this board rather than copied. The vendor tree's
        // `qcom,pdc-ranges` maps PDC pins 0..0x5D onto GIC SPIs 0x1E0..0x23D,
        // and pins 0x1A, 0x1B, 0x1C and 0x1D therefore arrive as INTIDs 0x21A,
        // 0x21B, 0x21C and 0x21D - the four `ExclusiveAndWake` lines here - and
        // those four pins are exactly the ones this board wires up: the two
        // tsens blocks take 0x1A/0x1C and 0x1B/0x1D as their uplow and critical
        // interrupts. The remaining seven have no counterpart anywhere in the
        // vendor tree and are recorded as the family's.
        //
        // The field on `\_SB.ABD.ROP1` is how the PEP reaches the PMIC bus: one
        // I2C channel at address 1, raw bytes of 0x15, a 168-bit field, verbatim
        // from lisa. Our ABD declares the same GenericSerialBus region for it and
        // gains its own `_DEP` on this node in this same step, which is what
        // makes the region reachable in the first place.
        //
        // `GEPT` answers One here and 0x02 on PMAP above. That is not a
        // discrepancy: both follow lisa, whose PEP0 reads One and whose PMAP
        // reads 0x02, and the value is what the two drivers expect to read back
        // rather than anything this board measured.
        //
        // `ROST` and `NPUR` are the pairing AGR0 completes. NPUR is how the
        // platform tells the aggregation device what the power resource usage is:
        // it writes the second `_PUR` entry and notifies AGR0, which is declared
        // near the end of this file exactly as lisa's is declared after its PEP0.
        // The forward reference is the corpus's shape, not a concession.
        //
        // `INTR` is twenty-four entries, and all but two pairs of them are the
        // same in every table. The preamble - 0x02, One, 0x03, One, 0x06 and the
        // MMIO base 0x17911008 - is twenty of twenty. Then come four (address,
        // length) pairs. The first is the shared-memory window: lisa writes
        // 0x86000000 with 0x00200000, and three tables - a52q's, miatoll's and
        // surya's - write 0x80900000 with the same length. This board's is
        // 0x80900000 and the board says so twice over: the vendor tree reserves
        // exactly that address for two megabytes as a no-map region and the
        // `smem` node consumes it. The same three tables also move the third pair
        // together with it, writing 0x0C300000 with 0x0400 where the others write
        // 0x1000; this board's AOSS QMP node is `power-management@c300000` with a
        // length of 0x1000, so the pair here is the majority value and the
        // board's. The fourth is 0x01FD4000 with a length of 8 in twenty of
        // twenty, and the fifth 0x17C0000C in seventeen - neither has a node in
        // the vendor tree, and the second sits in the 0x17C00000 page this
        // board's own interrupt controller reaches at 0x17C000F0.
        //
        // `STND` returns `STNX`, the eleven D-state names, and that exact set is
        // carried by exactly two tables, lisa and a52sxq - again the two at this
        // `_HID`. Every other table's set is a different length or a different
        // list, so the warrant here is the family's and not a majority's.
        //
        // `PPPP` is forty-six rails, and every one of them is a regulator node
        // in this board's own tree rather than a copy: twenty-one under the
        // pm6350 (SMPS1_A, SMPS2_A and nineteen LDOs), twelve under the pm6150l
        // (SMPS8_E, which is `vreg_bob`, and eleven LDOs), seven under the
        // pm8008, and the six DV triplets. The order is the corpus's - the SMPS
        // of every bucket first, then the LDO of every bucket, then the DV
        // triplet - and all forty-six names are in qcpep7280.sys's own
        // vocabulary, which is the check that says the strings are the driver's
        // and not ours. There is no CXO_BUFFERS or BUCK_BOOST entry, because
        // this board's tree declares neither.
        //
        // `THTZ` is the zone dispatcher, four arguments: the zone, a value, a
        // write flag and a selector. It is written over the thirteen zones this
        // table declares and over no others, and each zone's selectors are the
        // ones its own declarations carry - selector 0 for TPSV and `_PSV`, 1
        // for TCRT and `_CRT`, 2 for TTSP and `_TSP`, 3 for TTC1 and `_TC1`, 4
        // for TTC2 and `_TC2`, with 0xFFFF for anything unhandled at either
        // level. That reading of the selectors is taken from lisa's TZ31, the
        // one zone in the corpus that declares all five.
        //
        // The key set is where this node does not copy. The corpus's THTZ
        // methods are written from the platform's own thermal inventory rather
        // than from the zone bodies next to them - lisa's dispatches thirty-two
        // keys and writes TPSV into TZ13, a zone that declares no member at all
        // - so copying a key set would mean writing members into zones by number
        // and hoping they match. This table's inventory is the thirteen zones it
        // has, so the thirteen are the keys, and the per-zone selector sets come
        // from the declarations directly. Each key block carries its own
        // temporary for the selector copy - `_T_1` for the first key up to
        // `_T_D` for the thirteenth - because the name is scoped to the method
        // and not to the block, and lisa's compiled THTZ shows exactly that:
        // thirty-three of them, `_T_0` for the zone copy and `_T_1` through
        // `_T_W` for its thirty-two keys. It is the compiler's own numbering and
        // it is also the ceiling on this shape of method: a key set larger than
        // thirty-six blocks has no `_T_` digit left to name.
        //
        // The four groups this table does not
        // have - the PMIC group, the ADC group, TZ99 and the nine 04C0-04C8 the

        // thermal block above.
        //

        // The id. The census above settles it the same way it settled PM01: the
        // low pair is the block and the middle byte is the generator family. 0C
        // is the TLMM block on all five modern families (09 0A 0C 1A 25), 0D on
        // the older three (05 08 14) and 17 on 02 - which is why gauguin's
        // window at gauguin's exact length reads QCOM1A0C in Lahaina's
        // DSDT_MTP. gauguin's family byte is 0A, so the id is QCOM0A0C, and
        // that is the one id qcgpio7280.inf claims:
        //
        //   %GPIO.DeviceDesc%=GPIO_Inst,ACPI\QCOM0A0C
        //
        // whose binary is qcgpio.sys, and whose device description is the name
        // quoted above.
        //
        // The window is gauguin's own and not a copy: the device tree's
        // pinctrl@f100000 states reg = <0x00 0xf100000 0x00 0x300000>. Ten of
        // the 21 corpus tables carry that same pair; the rest track whatever
        // their own generation's TLMM window is.
        //
        // The interrupts. Nine of them, INTID = 32 + SPI, all Level and
        // ActiveHigh, because that is what the device tree states -
        //
        //   interrupts = <0x00 0xd0 0x04 ... 0x00 0xd8 0x04>   ->  0xF0 ... 0xF8
        //
        // - and the corpus agrees on the first one from the other side: all 21
        // tables put 0xF0 first, and 0xF0 is 32 + 0xD0, gauguin's first line.
        // What the corpus does with the *later* lines is a generator artefact
        // rather than a reading: every one of the 21 repeats its first value
        // instead of incrementing it, three or four times, so no table in the
        // corpus demonstrates what a second TLMM line looks like. gauguin's
        // device tree is the only authority for lines two through nine, it
        // declares nine, and so nine are written.
        //
        // What is deliberately not here:
        //
        //   - The rest of the corpus _CRS interrupt list. It is not the three
        //     entries an earlier reading of a truncated dump made it: it runs
        //     from 8 to 77 entries and it is board data, not SoC data - vili
        //     and venus are both SM8350 and carry 24 and 77 - with values that
        //     are INTIDs of direct-connect and PDC-mapped pin lines. gauguin's
        //     device tree does not carry that list in derivable form: its
        //     pinctrl nodes name functions and its PDC states ranges of
        //     possible pin-to-SPI mappings (qcom,pdc-ranges = <0x00 0x1E0 0x5E
        //     ...>, 153 pins over five ranges), not the pins the board uses. An
        //     invented catalogue is worse than an absent one, so this node
        //     declares the controller's own nine lines and stops. The cost is
        //     the usual one and it is stated: a per-pin line that only the
        //     catalogue would advertise is not advertised, until the device
        //     that needs it is added with its own GpioInt.
        //   - OFNI is written, and the reason is worth recording twice, because
        //     an earlier pass of this file omitted it for the wrong reason and
        //     the pass that restored it then gave it the wrong value.
        //     The omission: it counted occurrences of the name *in the 21 tables
        //     that have a GIO0*. 19 of those 21 define it - 18 as a Method, one
        //     on Blackbolt as a Name - and none of the 18 contains a third
        //     occurrence, so the rule "dead code is not ported" dropped it. The
        //     rule was right and the caller set was wrong: the caller is not in
        //     any table, it is qcgpio7280/qcgpio.sys, and qcgpio7280.inf proves
        //     the pairing - `GPIO_Inst,ACPI\QCOM0A0C` and `ServiceBinary =
        //     qcgpio.sys`, against this node's own _HID. The image carries
        //     exactly one string that can be an ACPI method name, and it is
        //     `OFNI`. (Its other four-character uppercase runs are `PAGE`,
        //     `INIT`, `RSDS` and `GCTL` - section names and a debug directory
        //     signature, consecutive with the build's own pdb path - plus
        //     register-scan fragments.) Its imports agree: ntoskrnl.exe and
        //     WDFLDR.SYS only, and of those, RtlInitializeBitMap, RtlSetBits,
        //     RtlFindSetBits and RtlNumberOfSetBits are a bitmap API, the shape
        //     of a driver sizing one bit per pin; the class extension is bound
        //     through WdfVersionBindClass rather than imported by name, which is
        //     why GpioClx appears nowhere in this image - the only file in the
        //     shipped set that imports it by name is qcpmicgpio7280.sys, the
        //     PMIC GPIO miniport.
        //     The value: OFNI is the TLMM's GPIO count, and the corpus settles
        //     what "count" means - most of the way, and the part it does not
        //     settle is worth as much as the part it does. Two numbers are
        //     available on any Qualcomm TLMM: the count of pins that have a gpio
        //     function (the driver's gpio_groups[] list) and the width Linux
        //     gives the gpiochip (.ngpios, which on all five SoCs below is
        //     gpio_groups + 1 and which the SoC dtsi's gpio-ranges copies
        //     wherever it is not one less). Where a corpus table, the mainline
        //     driver and the SoC dtsi can all be read:
        //                     corpus                    gpio_groups .ngpios dtsi
        //         sm8150  175 x4 cepheus nabu vayu mh2      175      176    176

        //     Ten of these fourteen tables answer the gpio count. The minority
        //     are SM8350 boards, and they are not consistent among themselves -
        //     venus and vili say 204 while lemonade and the Qualcomm reference
        //     MTP say 203, on the same silicon - so the minority is a per-board
        //     choice and not a platform generation. (Two further 204s, renoir
        //     and Cedros_IDP, are SDM7350 tables; this tree has no sm7350
        //     pinctrl driver, so they can be counted but not placed.)
        //     The evidence that bears on gauguin directly is lisa and a52sxq.
        //     Their GIO0 carries this node's own _HID, QCOM0A0C - the id
        //     qcgpio7280.inf binds qcgpio.sys to - where the SM8350 tables use
        //     QCOM1A0C and the SM8250 tables QCOM250C. Same driver, same idiom,
        //     same TLMM generation as gauguin, and both answer the gpio count
        //     (175, against a chip width of 176).
        //     The pin the two numbers differ by is real and is not a gpio:
        //     pinctrl-sm6350.c's descriptor list runs to PINCTRL_PIN(163), of
        //     which 0..155 are `GPIO_n`, 156 is `UFS_RESET` and 157..163 are the
        //     SDC lines. UFS_RESET has no gpio function - it is absent from
        //     gpio_groups[] - but Linux still numbers it line 156, which is why
        //     `.ngpios` is 157 and why gauguin's own board dts says
        //     `reset-gpios = <&tlmm 156 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>` under `&ufs_mem_hc`:
        //     the one tlmm reference on this board outside 0..94, and it is the
        //     line the two candidate counts disagree about. The vendor dtb's
        //     `gpio-ranges = <&tlmm 0 0 0x9D>` is that same chip width, and one
        //     build of this node answered 0x009D on the strength of it. It is
        //     0x009C = 156.
        //     What would change it, and the reason this is not a coin flip to
        //     revisit later: 156 is inert while nothing on this board names a
        //     pin above 155 through ACPI, and nothing does - there is no GpioIo
        //     or GpioInt on GIO0 at all yet. If a later step gives the UFS node
        //     the reset line the Linux side actually drives through pad 156,
        //     this must become 0x9D, because the class extension cannot hand a
        //     client a line the count excludes. One byte, one rebuild.
        //   - Kailua's GPIV, GPIC, GPIW and GPIB are not written. They are
        //     defined on a table with no _CRS, no other table has them, and the
        //     shipped driver set contains no reference to any of the four.
        //   - _AEI. Eight of the 21 tables have none at all. Nothing in this
        //     table declares a GpioInt on GIO0 yet, so there are no event pins
        //     to list; when a node is added that has one, its pin goes here.
        //     gauguin's buttons are not candidates - they hang off pm6350 GPIO
        //     2, which is PM01's block - and no _AEI is better than one that
        //     names pins nothing asked for.
        //
        // _DSM is carried because all 21 tables have it, and because the UUID
        // is the same string in every one of them: it is Microsoft's GPIO
        // Controller method, not a Qualcomm convention. Revision 3 is the
        // corpus majority and what both family-0A tables answer, and function 1
        // returns the family-0A value - 0x0100 on lisa and a52sxq, against
        // 0x0140 on venus and vili and 0xFFFF on lemonade, renoir, Cedros and
        // Lahaina. Kailua's generator answers revision 1 with a second UUID, and
        // it is the same generator that omits _REG; it is not gauguin's family.
        // Function 2 and above fall out of the method and return implicit zero,
        // the same way PM01's does and for the reason its note gives; the
        // corpus reaches that result through a BreakPoint, which is not carried.
        //
        // That the miniport is not what evaluates _DSM is worth recording, and
        // it is the one place where this file's earlier reading of qcgpio.sys
        // was wrong: the claim was that the image contains no ACPI method name
        // at all and imports nothing GPIO-related but the class extension. The
        // image does contain a method name - OFNI, above - and finding it took
        // testing the strings rather than counting them in the tables, because
        // a four-character name is short enough to appear inside compiler
        // symbols by accident: the shipped set's HSEN hits are all one mangled
        // LLVM symbol, _ZNK4llvm18QGPUTargetLowering10LowerMULHSENS_..., and
        // its URSI hits are all RECURSIVE_TILING and RECURSION_DEPTH. OFNI has
        // no such competitor, and it is the only such string in the driver.
        // _DSM and _AEI remain the class extension's, on the Windows side,
        // which is why the ids and the shapes below have to match what that
        // extension expects rather than what qcgpio.sys says - and it is also
        // why OFNI, which qcgpio.sys does say, has to be here.
        //
        // _REG and GABL are carried because 19 of the 21 have the pair. Its
        // reader set is empty here: the only nodes in the corpus that read it
        // are GIO0's own methods and RP1 on caymanslm, gating on the
        // functional-fixed-hardware region handler's arrival. Nothing on gauguin
        // reads it, so it is written and never read, which is inert.
        //
        // BAM1 - the crypto BAM, and the first node here whose _CRS a table and
        // the board state identically. Its id is the platform-prefix form every
        // node in this file already carries: QCOM0A0B at SPMI, QCOM0A0C at GIO0,
        // QCOM0A0D at IPC0, QCOM0A09 at both MMUs, QCOM0A10 at the three QUP
        // wrappers, QCOM0A16 at UAR2, QCOM0A2B/2C/2D at PMIC, PMAP and PM01.
        // The prefix 0A is this platform's and the suffix is the device. Not
        // every id in a table carries it - the subsystem services (QCOM06E0 at
        // PILC, 06E1 at RPEN, 06DC at TFTP, 06C2 at IPCC), the storage
        // controllers (QCOM24A5 at UFS0, 24BF and 2466 at SDC1 and SDC2) and
        // SCM0 and TREE (QCOM04DD, 04DE) are the same in every table, which is
        // why those four steps had to determine their ids by other means. The
        // platform-device nodes do carry it, and they carry the same suffix
        // across tables of the same platform: this file writes PMIC, PMAP, PM01
        // and PML0 as QCOM0A2B, 0A2C, 0A2D and 0AD3, and lisa writes exactly
        // that; miatoll writes 082E, 082F, 0830 and 08B4, caymanslm 0266, 0268
        // and 0269 with no PML0 at all.
        //
        // The BAM suffix is 0A wherever the prefix is 0A, so lisa and a52sxq
        // both write QCOM0A0A and miatoll writes QCOM080A. Every BAM in a table

        // QGP1, SCM0 and CPU0 through CPU3, all of them 21 of 21 in both
        // directions - and a seventeenth at 20, PRTC, which precedes BAM1 in the
        // 20 of the 21 tables that carry a PRTC, vili having none. The set is 356
        // votes. Scored over the slots it admits the maximum is 335,
        // and the vote alone does not make that slot unique: every slot after
        // PRTC and before RPEN ties, because the nodes the corpus puts between
        // PRTC and BAM1 - PMBM, BCL1, PMGK and PEP0, in that order in 21 of 21 -
        // are absent here. What separates the tie is adjacency rather than
        // counting: BAM1's immediate predecessor in the corpus is PEP0 in 16
        // tables, WLDS in 4 and PMGK in 1, never PRTC, so the relation the corpus
        // states is "immediately after that absent run", and the nearest preceding
        // node this table actually has is PRTC in 20 of 21 and PM01 in vili. So
        // the pair goes immediately after PRTC - declaration 8 counting from
        // zero, the numbering the corpus indices above use, and 13 until Step 4.88
        // reordered the file - which is where it was written.
        //
        // Sixteen of the seventeen relations are satisfied at that slot and the
        // seventeenth was SPMI's, and this file's order was why: SPMI was written
        // at declaration 6 and ABD, PMIC and PM01 followed it at 7, 8 and 10, so
        // "after PM01" and "before SPMI" could not both hold. The corpus puts SPMI
        // at declaration 59 of 140 in lisa and 56 of 143 in a52sxq, counting
        // unique declarations from zero - after SCM0, TLOG and TREE. So this node
        // cost 21 votes against SPMI and nothing
        // else, and that was recorded as a debt rather than a property. Step 4.88
        // paid it: the file was reordered into the corpus's own order, SPMI moved
        // to its slot after SCM0, and all seventeen of these relations now hold.
        // The debt's own sentence named this as "the first thing a later step that
        // reorders this file should do", and the two measurements it cites did
        // agree about where the fault was.

        // The body is the shape all twenty-one agree on without exception: _HID in
        // 21, _UID One in 21, _CCA Zero in 21, _CRS in 21, and in the resource

        // no GpioIo, no second interrupt and no other resource anywhere in the
        // class. _SUB is the local form of the alias the corpus writes as
        // \_SB.PSUB in 20, with Waipio using a method in the 21st - Waipio
        // departing at the same member here as at GLNK, IPC0 and TFTP. _STA is in
        // exactly two tables, vili and Waipio, returning 0x0F in both, the same
        // pair that adds it at the four nodes above. And there is no _DEP in any
        // of the 21: this node has no dependency at all, which is unusual for a

        // GLNK names IPCC and RPEN - and it is measured rather than assumed, the
        // way ABD's withheld dependency was.

        // The two SPI engines are the two not written, and for one reason:
        // nothing can bind them. Every .inf in the SC7280 set was read for the
        // id, and of the four QUP ids the set carries - QCOM0A0B, QCOM0A0C,
        // QCOM0A10, QCOM0A16 - the SPI engine's QCOM0A0E is not among them. The
        // same search over the other four driver trees in ~/work/woa-ref finds
        // it nowhere at all. Writing SP1 and SP10 would therefore register two
        // unknown devices that reserve 0x880000 and 0x98c000 and their GSIs
        // against no driver, and would describe the touch as reachable over a
        // bus this table cannot open. They are withheld, not refused: lisa
        // declares an SP14, so the family does write one, and if a driver for
        // QCOM0A0E ever appears the node is four lines of the same shape.
        //
        // What the touch actually is decides something else, and it is worth
        // writing down because it reads backwards at first. spi@880000's child
        // is touch_spi@0, and it carries a compatible, a reg of 0 and a 10 MHz
        // clock and nothing else - "xiaomi,spi-for-tp", correctly spelled, with
        // no interrupt, no reset and no supply. The touch chip's node is on the
        // I2C engine: focaltech@38 on i2c@988000, with focaltech,irq-gpio and
        // focaltech,reset-gpio on TLMM pins 22 and 21, a vdd-supply, six panel
        // phandles, its own pinctrl for the interrupt and the reset, and
        // qcom,i2c-touch-active = "focaltech,fts_ts" naming it the active one.
        // So the chip is at I2C address 0x38 on slot 9 and the SPI node is
        // there to hold the engine. No driver in the set drives the chip on
        // either bus - there is no touch .inf in it at all - which is why the
        // child is not written and why I2C9 alone does not give touch.
        //
        // I2C8 and I2C9 are the same node as IC11 with a different slot, and

        // PEP0 landed in Step 4.93, and the count that was expected to settle
        // the rest did not have to: of the 53 I2C nodes 43 write PEP0 alone, 8

        // two, and the readings below name which.
        //
        // The board's own fields say four-wire. gauguin's only enabled GENI
        // UART is qcom,qup_uart@884000, and it carries compatible
        // "qcom,msm-geni-serial-hs", the high-speed serial, which is the
        // compatible the family's Bluetooth-over-UART shape uses; a
        // pinctrl-names of "default", "active" and "sleep", three states where
        // both console nodes this board declares have two; and a pin group,
        // qupv3_se1_4uart_pins, of five sub-groups - default_ctsrtsrx,
        // default_tx, ctsrx, rts and tx - where those two consoles' groups hold
        // active and sleep and nothing else. It also carries qcom,wakeup-byte =
        // <0xfd>. Its interrupts-extended first entry <0x1 0 0x25a 4> gives the
        // GSI 0x25A + 32 = 0x27A; the second is on phandle 0xc1, the PDC, the
        // wake path rather than a resource to publish.
        //
        // The corpus says the same from the other side. Every four-wire UART it
        // carries is the dependency of a Bluetooth node: lisa's UAR8, a52sxq's
        // UAR8, alioth's UAR7 and venus's UR21 are each named in their table's
        // BTH0 _DEP, which reads {PEP0, PMIC, UAR8} in lisa's shape, in all ten
        // of them - and the shape is not the tag's, since nine further tables
        // write the same three entries around a port with no ,4W suffix, so all
        // nineteen BTH0s in the corpus name their own table's UART that way.
        // This table has no BTH0 - the board's Bluetooth is a SLIMbus
        // device, wcn3990 under slim@3ac0000 with compatible
        // "qcom,btfmslim_slave" and status "ok", powered by the bt_wcn3990 node
        // with its four rails - so the port here has no dependent to name, and
        // the payload's tree is not disagreeing about the module when it hangs
        // a bluetooth child on serial@884000 (compatible "qcom,wcn3988-bt",
        // max-speed = <0x30d400>): it is the same module over the other of its
        // two host interfaces. A step that writes Bluetooth starts from one of
        // those two.
        //
        // The console is somewhere else, and four readings agree on where. Both
        // trees' aliases name serial0 at the 98c000 node; the payload's tree
        // gives serial@98c000 compatible "qcom,geni-debug-uart", status "okay"
        // and chosen/stdout-path "serial0:115200n8"; the board's own tree gives
        // that address compatible "qcom,msm-geni-console" and names it serial0
        // in its aliases too; and the firmware names one UART path in its
        // strings, /soc/qcom,qup_uart@98c000 beside /soc/spi@98c000, in both
        // its PE and its volume image. The board disables that node all the
        // same, because the SE under it is the IR blaster's SPI - the
        // disagreement the engine list above already records for spi@98c000,
        // recorded again here and not repaired. So the console this table could
        // name sits on the SPI engine's SE, and androidboot.console=ttyMSM0,
        // which the boot image's cmdline carries, names a kernel console device
        // and not an engine: it decides nothing here.
        //
        // So the node is written as what the board enables and not as what the
        // family calls the role. The name is the slot, and the slot is the
        // engine's SE number plus one: the CRD's I2C1 is its wrapper 0 SE 0 and
        // takes _UID One, and the eight-per-wrapper form the I2C engine below
        // derives, _UID = 8 * wrapper + SE index + 1, is that same rule on an
        // SoC whose wrappers carry eight SEs. This engine's SE number is 1 - the
        // board's own alias block writes qupv3_se1_4uart for 0x884000 - so
        // 1 + 1 = 2, and UAR2 is that number in the family's own UART form, which
        // is the prefix and the _UID in all ten of the four-wire tables. The
        // lowest UAR number the corpus carries is 4, so this exact name is
        // derived and not witnessed; the form is witnessed ten times, and the
        // _STR carries no tag, the way 32 of those 48 corpus nodes do.
        //
        // The eight-per-wrapper form is not this board's, and the three
        // wrapper-1 nodes below are the ones it gets wrong. Measured over the
        // corpus it fits all nineteen of the tagged engine nodes in wrapper 0 and
        // seventeen of the twenty-seven at wrappers 1 and 2, and the ten that do
        // not fit sit in six tables whose tags contradict the addresses of the
        // same table's other nodes - alioth's "QUP_2_SE_1" sits at 0x884000,
        // below its own "QUP_0_SE_1" at 0x984000. gauguin's wrappers count six:
        // the board numbers 0x980000 through 0x990000 qupv3_se6 through
        // qupv3_se10, the SoC's own tree agrees (i2c6, i2c7, i2c8, uart9, i2c10),
        // and wrapper 1's GPI DMA masks six channels (0x3f). So 0x984000 is SE 7
        // and not the ten the ladder gives it, 0x988000 is SE 8 and not 11, and
        // 0x990000 is SE 10 and not 13: those three _UIDs, and the names that
        // followed them, were each two too high. Step 4.86 measured that and
        // Step 4.87 applied it - the three nodes below are I2C8 (_UID 8), I2C9
        // (_UID 9) and IC11 (_UID 0x0B) - and the correction is witnessed and
        // not only derived, by a second SoC of this generation whose wrappers
        // are shaped like this one's. miatoll's wrapper 1 starts at 0xA80000 and
        // its wrapper 0 carries six SEs as well - I2C1 at 0x880000 is _UID One,
        // UAR4 at 0x88C000 is _UID 4, I2C5 at 0x890000 is 5, each SE plus one -
        // so its global SE numbers start at 6 exactly as gauguin's 0x980000
        // does, and it names the engines after that base I2C8 at 0x00A84000
        // (_UID 0x08), UARD at 0x00A88000 (0x09), IC10 at 0x00A8C000 (0x0A) and
        // SP12 at 0x00A94000 (0x0C): SE 7, 8, 9 and 11 by the same rule, with
        // 0x00A90000 - SE 10 - unwritten between the last two. a52q, the same
        // part under Samsung, writes the first three and IC12 for SP12, which is
        // the SP14/IC14 lesson below a third time. So gauguin's 0x984000 being
        // SE 7, _UID 8 and I2C8 is not only the arithmetic that follows from
        // six-per-wrapper: it is the name two other tables of this generation
        // write at that SE.
        //
        // _STA is left out on purpose, and the family's practice is split by
        // role rather than uniform. All thirteen UARDs are visible - twelve
        // write no _STA and surya's writes 0x0F - while the four-wire ports are
        // mostly hidden: sixteen of the twenty-one UAR and UR nodes return
        // 0x0B, present but not shown, including both of this generation's
        // QCOM0A16, lisa's UAR8 and a52sxq's, and the three that write no _STA
        // at all are alioth's UAR7 and pipa's UR14 and UR20, while the two that
        // return 0x0F are cepheus's UR18 and surya's UAR4. The hiding tracks the
        // claimant, and the claimant is measurable: nineteen tables in the
        // corpus carry a BTH0 and in all nineteen its _DEP is
        // {PEP0, PMIC, <that table's own UART>} - the ten ,4W,BT ports and nine
        // untagged ones - and sixteen of those nineteen hide the port while
        // three, alioth's and the two QCOM1418 tables', show it. This board's
        // Bluetooth is on SLIMbus and not on this engine, so there is nothing
        // here for Windows to collide with and no role the hiding would serve.
        //
        // The relation sets the comments below cite were measured again over the
        // four-wire ports, since that is the role this node now claims, and they
        // hold: the UART precedes PILC, RPEN, GLNK, TFTP and IPC0 in 10 of 10,
        // is followed by QGP0 in 8 of 8 and QGP1, MMU0, MMU1 and SCM0 in 10 of
        // 10 each, and precedes I2C8 and I2C9 in 2 of 2 each - the last the one
        // relation this file breaks, already charged to I2C8 below. The three
        // sites that cited the UART read "UARD (13 of 13)" and "UARD (13)"
        // before - the debug name's own node count - and read "the four-wire
        // ports (10 of 10)" and "(10)" now; the counts standing beside them are
        // relations about other nodes and did not change. The role change moves
        // no slot, and the corrected counts are written there.
        //
        // The _DEP is written in Step 4.94 and is the one-entry form. The

        // So this board names the block four times over, three of them in its own

        // The corpus declares a PILC in 19 of its 66 tables, under seven ids, one
        // per generation:
        //
        //   06E0 x6   a52sxq, lisa, renoir, Cedros IDP, Kailua MTP, Kailua QRD
        //   1AE0 x3   051B x5   04DF x2   023B x1 (caymanslm)
        //   14DF x1 (surya)      25E0 x1 (alioth)
        //
        // The same seven generations appear on PILC's six siblings - RPEN 06E1,
        // SSVC 06DB, TFTP 06DC, QCDB 06DE, PDSR 06DF, SOCP 06DD - each of them in
        // the 06 form 6 or 7 times and in the older forms once or twice per
        // generation, with SOCP alone having no 02 form at all. And the generation
        // is a property of the table and not of the SoC: of the 20 tables that
        // carry three or more of the seven, 19 write a single generation across
        // all of them, and the twentieth, caymanslm, writes 02 for six and 03 for
        // the seventh - the corpus's oldest board slipping once, and not a second
        // rule.
        //
        // The driver set then picks one generation of the seven, and it picks 06.
        // qcpil.inf matches ACPI\QCOM06E0 and installs the service qcPILC on it,
        // which is this node's name in lower case; qcpilfilterext.inf matches the
        // same id as Class=Extension with an upper filter, QCPILFilter.sys, so the
        // set ships a function driver and a filter for this one PIL id and for no
        // other; and no inf in the set names 051B, 1AE0, 04DF, 023B, 14DF or
        // 25E0, here or on any of the six siblings. The corpus's 1A boards -
        // lemonade and venus - write QCOM1AE0 on a node that is otherwise this
        // one, and that id binds to nothing on this host. The id is the driver's,
        // as on every node here, and the driver's generation is this table's
        // generation. This table's IPCC has carried QCOM06C2 since Step 4.73,
        // written before any of this was measured; it is in the same generation,
        // and that is the one confirmation of the rule already inside the file.
        //
        // The body follows the six tables whose id this is. _STA returning 0x0F is
        // this file's convention on every device it writes, so it is here for the
        // file's reason and not the corpus's - which is as well, because the
        // corpus's answer does not support the derivation this paragraph used to
        // make. Measured: 11 of the 19 carry it and 8 do not, and the split is
        // not "the newest against the two older" but the 06, 14, 1A and 25 forms
        // carrying it against the 02, 04 and 05 forms. Of the eight, seven write
        // _HID alone; the eighth is caymanslm's 02 form, which adds a PILX method
        // returning a one-element package and an ACPO method besides. The old
        // sentence said "9 of the 19 ... absent from the two older ones ... in all
        // 7"; it was wrong on the count and on the oldest board, and Step 4.81
        // measured it again while deriving RPEN's body, where the same split comes
        // out differently again - 12 of 21, and 14 disagrees with itself. The
        // correction is recorded rather than quietly made. The alias is narrower:
        // four of
        // the six 06 tables omit it - a52sxq, lisa, renoir and Cedros' IDP - and
        // the two that carry Alias (\_SB.PSUB, _SUB) are Kailua's MTP and QRD
        // board files, one SoC's two files agreeing with each other and with the
        // 1A form's three. The four that omit it are three phone tables and one
        // silicon IDP, and that makes PILC the first device here without a _SUB.
        // The reason is the node's role rather than a preference: the loader does
        // not sit inside a subsystem, it brings subsystems up, and the corpus's
        // own phone tables say so by carrying the alias on RPEN, TFTP, PDSR and
        // SSVC beside this node. There is also no _SUB value here that would be
        // right - this board's PSUB is "MTP07225" where the drivers' own reference
        // tables compare against IDP07280 and CRD07280, the mismatch the IPCC node
        // records - so the omission is the safer half of the choice as well.
        //
        // No _UID, no _CRS and no _DEP. The first two hold for all nineteen
        // tables: no PILC anywhere carries either. So does the third, and the
        // dependency in this group does not run through PILC - TFTP's _DEP names
        // IPC0, PDSR's names PEP0, GLNK and IPC0, SSVC's names IPC0 and QDIG, and
        // none of those four devices is in this table.
        //
        // Position, derived as usual. RPEN is immediately before PILC in 19 of 19
        // and CDI immediately after in 19 of 19, so this node is the second member
        // of a run - RPEN, PILC, CDI, SCSS, ADSP, SLM1, ADCM, AUDD - that no table
        // ever splits. Neither neighbour is here, so the slot comes from the
        // relations this file can check: the four-wire ports (10 of 10), I2C8
        // (9 of 9) and I2C9 (3 of 3) precede it, and MMU0, MMU1 and SCM0 (19 of
        // 19 each), IPCC (10 of 10), QGP0 (17) and QGP1 (19) follow it. Every
        // one of those nine is satisfied by the slot below, and no later slot
        // is: between QGP1 and MMU0 the two QGP relations break instead. Six further relations are
        // unsatisfiable in any slot, because this file placed UCS0, URS0, USB0,
        // UFN0, SPMI and GIO0 earlier than the corpus's order has them while the
        // corpus puts all six after PILC - SPMI, URS0, USB0, UFN0 and GIO0 in 19
        // of 19 each, UCS0 in 10 of 10, it being absent from nine of the tables.
        // This said "three" and named USB0, SPMI and GIO0 until Step 4.81 measured
        // it again while deriving RPEN's slot and found the same six there; the
        // correction is recorded rather than quietly made. They are recorded here
        // rather than repaired: this step is a node, and a reordering is its own
        // measurement.
        // RPEN is the Reset Power Error Notifier - qcrpen.inf's own description
        // string for it - the device Windows listens to for resets and power
        // errors rather than reaches hardware through. Its service is QCRPEN, its
        // binary qcrpen.sys, it is a KMDF driver, its class is System, it asks for
        // no address and no interrupt, its ACL admits only the built-in Admins and
        // Local System (D:P(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GA;;;SY)), it sets PnpLockDown, and it
        // declares WDTFSOCDeviceCategory - the SoC device category the Windows
        // Driver Test Framework finds these devices by.
        //
        // Its id is the other half of PILC's, and the shape of the pairing is
        // worth writing down because it is not what "two co-issued ids" usually
        // means. The corpus declares this node under seven ids - QCOM06E1 seven
        // times, QCOM0533 five, QCOM1AE1 four, QCOM04E0 two, and QCOM026D,
        // QCOM14E0 and QCOM25E1 once each - and they are the same seven
        // generations PILC's are. In five of the seven the two are consecutive:
        // the 06, 1A and 25 generations are E0 and E1, and the 14 and 04
        // generations are DF and E0. In the other two they are not: the 05
        // generation is PILC 051B beside RPEN 0533, and caymanslm's 02 generation
        // is PILC 023B beside RPEN 026D. So the two nodes are issued together
        // without being numbered together, and this id could not be derived from
        // PILC's by counting one up.
        //
        // What decides it is what decided PILC's: the driver set. qcrpen.inf
        // carries one line of hardware id - %RPEN.DeviceDesc%=RPEN_Device,
        // ACPI\QCOM06E1 - and no inf in the 112 names any of the other six, so
        // the 06 generation is the one that binds. The generation is this table's,
        // as PILC's comment records at length; this node is that rule's first
        // confirmation from outside, because it is a second node that had to come
        // out the same way on its own.
        //
        // The body is the second shortest in the file - one member longer than PILC's,
        // because it carries the alias PILC does not - and it is PILC's mirror image.
        // Where PILC's 06 tables mostly omit the alias, all twenty-one RPENs carry
        // it: twenty as Alias (\_SB.PSUB, _SUB), and one - Waipio - as the
        // Method (_SUB) { Return (\_SB.PSUB) } form that the PEP0 comment already
        // records as Waipio's habit, the same file twice. And where PILC has no
        // _CRS, no _UID and no _DEP, neither has RPEN, in any of the twenty-one.
        // The alias is therefore the pair's one difference, and the role reading
        // fits it: PILC brings subsystems up and stands outside them, RPEN reports
        // on them and stands inside. That is a reading and not a measurement - the
        // corpus never says so - but it is the reading that makes both bodies
        // consistent rather than arbitrary, and it is why this file writes the
        // alias here and does not write it there.
        //
        // _STA returning 0x0F is this file's convention on every device it writes,
        // so it is here for the file's reason and not the corpus's. The corpus's
        // own answer, measured, is 12 of the twenty-one - every 06 table, every 1A
        // table, and alioth - against 9 that write _HID and the alias alone: the
        // 05, 04, 02 and 14 forms. Note the 14: surya's PILC carries a _STA and
        // surya's RPEN does not, so within one table of one generation the two
        // nodes disagree. The id is a property of the table, as the last step
        // measured; _STA is not, and nothing here should be written as if it were.
        //
        // _DEP needs a sentence even though there is none, because RPEN is the
        // first node in this file whose absence another node's dependency list
        // names. GLNK's _DEP is Package (0x02){ \_SB.IPCC, \_SB.RPEN } in 12 of its
        // twenty-one tables and Package (One){ \_SB.RPEN } in the other nine, so on
        // all twenty-one reference boards GLNK cannot start until RPEN is there -
        // and this file's GLNK, written in Step 4.82, names this node in its own
        // _DEP. Nothing in this group depends on RPEN directly: the group's own
        // _DEP entries name IPC0 (TFTP), PEP0, GLNK and IPC0 (PDSR), IPCC and QDIG
        // (SSVC), and none of those five is in this table. GLNK is not in this
        // group and is claimed, which is why the dependency is recorded.
        //
        // Position, and it is the strongest relation in this file's corpus
        // evidence so far: RPEN is immediately before PILC in 19 of the 19 tables
        // that have a PILC. The predecessor is board-specific and useless - SPI4
        // three times, IC14 three, UR19, SP12 and UR15 twice each, then nine
        // singletons - which is the shape of a run's head when whatever precedes
        // it is the last member of the previous block. The two tables with no PILC
        // are the two that put something else after RPEN (vili names IPC0, Waipio
        // names TFTP), so RPEN leads the run's remainder rather than being pinned
        // to PILC. The run itself - RPEN, PILC, CDI, SCSS, ADSP, SLM1, ADCM, AUDD
        // - is never split in any of the 19: measured as a question about the
        // members a table actually has, no table ever interposes a node between
        // two of them, though the adjacencies vary because SCSS is missing from
        // nine of the 19.
        //
        // So the slot is fixed by the node after it, which is already here.
        // Fifteen relations agree with it. Before: UFS0, DEV0, ABD, PMIC and PM01
        // (21 of 21 each), PMAP and PRTC (20), the four-wire ports (10), PML0
        // (11) and I2C8 (9).
        // After: PILC (19 of 19), QGP1 and SCM0 (21), QGP0 (19) and IPCC (12).
        // Six relations no slot could satisfy, and they are the same six PILC's
        // comment records: UCS0 (10 of 10), URS0, USB0, UFN0 and GIO0 (20
        // each) and SPMI (21) all sit after RPEN in the corpus and all sat before
        // it in this file, because this file wrote the early block in an order of
        // its own in which ABD - unanimous before RPEN - keeps company with
        // devices the corpus puts after. They were recorded and not repaired, as
        // there: a reordering is its own measurement. The full count of what this
        // order cost the corpus was measured at TFTP below (Step 4.84) and these
        // six were six of the 128 broken relations, over seven placements, one of
        // which was this one. Step 4.88 is that reordering, and all six are

        //
        // The four bus nodes are two thirds of the cost and they are one
        // decision: this file wrote the USB and storage block first and the
        // corpus writes that block after the cameras, near the end of its
        // tables. The rest is smaller and separately decided. That is the
        // baseline a slot argument has to be read against, and it corrects
        // something the four comments before this one imply. The corpus pins a
        // node only relative to other nodes, and this file has already declined
        // to follow it in seven places, so a slot is scored by how many of the
        // relations it satisfies and not by whether any are broken at all. The
        // six relations RPEN's, PILC's, IPC0's and GLNK's comments each record
        // as broken are six of the 128, and not a peculiarity of those slots.
        //
        // Scored that way there is one best slot for this node and it is unique.
        // The relations to satisfy are the 602 table-votes carried by the
        // thirty-two nodes this node has a unanimous relation with; the maximum
        // is 491, and exactly one slot reaches it - between PILC and IPC0. The
        // runner-up reaches 472 and the six votes it loses are PILC's: the
        // corpus puts PILC before TFTP in 19 of 19 tables that have both, vili
        // and Waipio being the two without a PILC. The six relations no slot can
        // satisfy are the block recorded above - UCS0 (10 of 10), URS0, USB0,
        // UFN0 and GIO0 (20 each) and SPMI (21) all follow TFTP in the corpus and
        // all precede it here. So the slot is fixed by the node above it and the
        // node below it, both of which are already in this file, and not by an
        // adjacency read off a corpus table.
        //
        // It cannot reproduce the neighbourhood it was measured in, and that
        // should be said plainly. In six of the seven tables that share this
        // table's service triple, TFTP stands inside the remoteproc cluster:
        // a52sxq, lisa and renoir read ... CSW0 SBTD TFTP QCSK MMU0 MMU1 IMM0
        // IMM1 GPU0 ..., and Cedros and both Kailua differ only in the four nodes
        // before SBTD. Not one of SBTD, QCSK, IMM0 or IMM1 is in this table, and
        // MMU0 and MMU1 are here but twenty nodes away. The seventh table of the
        // group is Waipio, and Waipio is the one that reads like this file:
        // ... BAM5 RPEN TFTP SCM0 TLOG SPMI IPCC IPC0 GLNK ..., with TFTP after
        // RPEN and before IPC0 and GLNK, which is the corridor this slot lands
        // in. Six tables agree on a neighbourhood that cannot be built here and
        // the seventh agrees on a relation that can. That is the whole of what
        // the corpus has to say about where this node goes.
        //
        // What it hands forward. BAM1 and BAM5 precede TFTP in 21 of 21 and
        // precede IPC0 in 21 of 21 and are still absent; in the nine generations
        // the corpus spreads them over, the two always carry the same id as each
        // other, QCOM0A0A in the two 0A tables. So they go between RPEN and this
        // node or between this node and IPC0, and their own comment will have to
        // choose, on the same 602-vote scale and against the same 128-relation
        // baseline this one was measured on. MMU0 and MMU1 want to be adjacent to
        // this node - MMU0 immediately follows TFTP in 7 tables, and the pair
        // follows QCSK in 12 - and cannot be until this file decides to move
        // them, which is a reordering and therefore its own measurement.

        // registers - carry the same reg, <0x3d40000 0x10000>, and both the
        // vendor tree and the kernel tree in Resources/DTBs agree on it. That
        // 0x10000 is a register footprint and not the block's size:
        // attach-impl-defs on this node reaches 0x6b68, which is the page the
        // driver's instance 1 calls implementation defined 1 at 0x06 pages, and
        // the instance-1 CB page is at 0x10 pages - exactly where a 0x10000
        // window ends. So the window is the base the board gives and the 0x20000
        // lisa and a52sxq give the same node, which is also the largest power of
        // two that stops short of the GPU's next region at 0x3d61000. Eight of
        // the 20 MMU1s write 0x10000, ten write 0x20000 and Kailua's two write

        // eight include the ones whose context ladder gauguin's matches, so the

        //
        // MMU1's interrupts are 10: two globals, 261 and 263, with
        // #global-interrupts = 2, and eight context banks at 396-403. The eight
        // are the group three other families write - caymanslm, a52q and
        // miatoll, and surya all declare 0x18C-0x193 for their MMU1 - while
        // gauguin's peers lisa and a52sxq put their ten at 710-719. The count is
        // the board's and the ladder is neither family's, which is what happened
        // at wrapper 1 of the GPI DMA above: the numbering agrees between two
        // SoCs where they instantiate the same block and not otherwise, and both
        // numbers here are measured. The board's own ladder backs the eight:
        // 0x18C-0x193 sits in the gap between MMU0's third run, which ends at
        // 0x179, and its fourth, which opens at 0x1B1.
        //
        // Both nodes carry the trigger the board's own cells give - type 4,
        // level, active high, on 81 of 81 and 10 of 10 - and this is the one
        // place in this file where the corpus disagrees with the board about a
        // trigger. All 1400 SMMU interrupt descriptors in the corpus say Edge,
        // ActiveHigh, Exclusive, in every family and every table. The corpus is
        // faithful elsewhere - its UFS0 and its QGP0 are Level, matching the
        // type cells gauguin's dts carries for the same blocks - so the
        // disagreement is specific to this block, and it is recorded rather than
        // resolved. The board's cell is what the kernel programs that GIC line
        // with; if the SMMU driver turns out never to fire, this is the cell to
        // flip first.
        //
        // The _DEP is written, and it took two steps to become writable. PEP0
        // landed in Step 4.93 - the referent every SMMU in the corpus names -
        // but the form needed a count first, and this file's older one was
        // wrong. Re-measured over the 20 tables that carry both SMMUs: MMU1
        // writes {PEP0} in all 20, and MMU0 writes {PEP0} in 11 against {MMU1}
        // in 9. So "the _DEP is {PEP0} in all 40 nodes" was wrong by 9, and the
        // entry could not be written until the split was resolved rather than
        // averaged.
        //
        // It resolves by _HID, which is the rule every other id in this table
        // follows. The nine {MMU1} writers are exactly QCOM0212 (1), QCOM0509
        // (5), QCOM0809 (2) and QCOM1409 (1); the eleven {PEP0} writers are
        // exactly QCOM0909 (2), QCOM0A09 (2), QCOM0C09 (2), QCOM1A09 (4) and
        // QCOM2509 (1). The boundary is a set and not a number - 0909 and 0A09
        // sit numerically between 0809 and 1409 and fall on the other side -
        // so there is no ordering rule to extrapolate and the two sets are
        // recorded as measured. The set is what decides it here anyway: this
        // board's id is QCOM0A09, whose only two other instances are lisa and
        // a52sxq, and both write {PEP0} on both SMMUs. Both nodes take the
        // one-entry form, and the split is a fact about the family rather than
        // about this board.
        //
        // (An older draft of this comment held the entry back for a second
        // reason - "a one-entry _DEP is a shape no table has" - and that reason
        // was wrong: Step 4.75 measured ABD's _DEP at one entry in 19 of 21
        // tables and PRTC's at one entry naming \_SB.PMAP as a string. What
        // makes an entry un-writable is a missing referent, not a small package.

        // absent; the reason did not.)

        //
        // and exactly one of the six is claimed by any .inf in the five driver
        // trees on this host - QCOM04DD, by the file above. So this is not a
        // case of the driver set agreeing with a majority: five of six ids have

        //
        // The shape is ABD's shape, and this step is the second place the pair

        // is the ninth and differs the same two ways it differs on ABD - no
        // _DEP at all, and _SUB written as a method returning \_SB.PSUB - and
        // it is also the one table of the 21 that carry an SCM0 which declares
        // no PEP0. So the two nodes agree about their odd table, which is worth
        // more than either agreement alone. This said "the only table in the
        // corpus with no PEP0" until Step 4.94, which is not true of the
        // corpus: 45 of its 65 reference tables declare no PEP0 device of their
        // own, three of them declaring no device at all. It is true of the
        // family the sentence is about, and the reading that keeps the two
        // apart is `tools/acpi-dep-census.py --carrier ABD SCM0`, which is what
        // the correction was made from.
        //
        // The _DEP is written, and the count that was open here in Step 4.93 is
        // the one this step closed. Across the 21 declarations the dependency
        // is present in 11 and absent in 10, which reads as a bare majority and
        // is not: the 10 are exactly the nine 050B, 080B, 140B and 0214 tables
        // - none of which writes a _DEP on any node of this name, in any
        // generation - and Waipio's QCOM04DD, which is the one of the 21 with
        // no PEP0 in it. So the choice is not open at all once the
        // declarations are split by _HID: this node's own id, QCOM04DD, writes
        // {PEP0} in 8 of its 9 instances and the ninth has nothing to name, and
        // the sibling id QCOM05DD writes it in all 3. 11 of the 12 tables at
        // 04DD or 05DD carry the entry, against 0 of 9 at the other four ids -
        // a rule about the id and not a vote. Step 4.93 recorded it as a bare
        // majority and left the entry out, and that reading was the mistake.
        //
        // _STA is written for ABD's reason: two of the 21 carry one and both
        // return 0x0F - Waipio and vili - and the nineteen that omit it are
        // present by ACPI default, so the method costs one line and removes the
        // ambiguity about whether the omission was a decision.

        // No _CRS, and here that is a fact about the device rather than about
        // the corpus: none of the 21 declarations has one, and gauguin's own
        // device tree agrees by carrying nothing to build one from - scm {
        // compatible = "qcom,scm-sm6350", "qcom,scm"; #reset-cells = <1>; } -

        // has nothing to add to it, which is the same reason there is nothing
        // for a _CRS to describe.

         * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
         * The PMIC family: SPMI, PMIC, PM01.  Step 4.63.
         *
         * Three nodes, and every number in them is either gauguin's own or a
         * constant measured across the corpus - nothing is inherited by
         * resemblance. The ids are the three the 7280 driver set claims:
         *
         *   QCOM0A0B  qcspmi7280.inf        QCOM0A2B  qcpmic7280.inf
         *   QCOM0A2D  qcpmicgpio7280.inf
         *
         * SPMI's window. gauguin's device tree gives the arbiter five regions:
         *
         *   core   0x0C440000 + 0x1100        obsrvr 0x0E600000 + 0x100000
         *   chnls  0x0C600000 + 0x2000000     intr   0x0E700000 + 0xA0000
         *   cnfg   0x0C40A000 + 0x26000
         *
         * which union to [0x0C40A000, 0x0E7A0000). _CRS states one window,
         * 0x0C400000 + 0x2800000, and that is not a copy: it is the value 18 of
         * the 20 SPMI _CRS in Silicium-ACPI carry - across SM8150, SM8250,
         * SM8350, SM7150, SM7125, SM6250 and SDM7280 alike - and it contains
         * every one of the five regions above. The same eight bytes appear
         * little-endian at offset 0x12 of SPMI.CONF, which is the same window
         * restated. The other two tables are Kailua's, and theirs is a different
         * window (0x0C400000 + 0x500000) for a different arbiter.
         *
         * SPMI.CONF is byte-identical in all 18 of those tables, Kailua's being
         * the sole variant, so it is copied verbatim rather than reconstructed:
         * 26 bytes whose only platform-dependent part is the window _CRS
         * already states. What the other 18 bytes configure is not established.
         *
         * PMIC.PMCF is the one method here with real platform content. 19 of the
         * 22 tables in Silicium-ACPI that have an SPMI node carry it, and no
         * table calls it: the PMIC driver calls it by name, so it is not
         * optional for a table that means to bind. (The three that omit it -
         * vili, kebab and Waipio - also omit PMAP and PMBM, and vili's whole
         * PMIC section is PMIC and PM01 and nothing else.) Its package is
         * <count>, then one entry per SPMI USID from 0 to the maximum, where a
         * present USID is the key and an absent one is keyed 0x10, and the
         * paired value is 0x10 on the newer platforms:
         *
         *   lisa, a52sxq (both 0A)   {0A, 0>10, 1>10, 2>10, 3>10, 4>10, 10>10 x5}
         *   Lahaina, venus, lemonade {0B, 0..5>10, 10>10 x4}
         *   renoir, Cedros (both 09) {06, 0,1,2,3>10, 10>10, 5>10}
         *   Kailua, Waipio (0C)      {0D, 0..7>10, 10>10 x4, 0C>16}
         *
         * Two readings of this package fit the older tables and only one fits
         * the newer. On SM8150/SM8250/SM7125 the values step by two -
         * alioth's is {04, 0>1, 2>3, 4>5, 6>7} - which reads as <primary USID,
         * companion USID>, one entry per PMIC, and that reading cannot explain
         * lisa's consecutive keys 0,1,2,3,4 or renoir's key 0x10 sitting between
         * 3 and 5. The reading that fits both is the one above: one entry per
         * USID from 0 up, placeholders for the gaps, and a value whose meaning
         * differs by generation - a companion on the old platforms, a peripheral
         * type on the new, where 0x16 appears once (Kailua, USID 12) and shows
         * the field is not a USID at all. The entry count is a per-family
         * constant: 10 for family 0A, 10 for 1A, 13 for 0C, 6 for 09.
         *
         * gauguin's device tree populates USIDs 0 through 6 - pm6350 at 0 and 1,
         * pm7250b at 2 and 3, pm6150l at 4 and 5, pmk8350 at 6, all seven
         * children of spmi@c440000 and none of them disabled, the pm8008 at
         * USID 8 being on I2C - and it is family 0A, so the package is lisa's
         * with USID 5 present instead of absent. What 0x10 means is still not
         * established; it is the value 12 tables give for every populated USID,
         * including renoir, which is SM7350 to gauguin's SM7225 and the closest
         * relative in the corpus.
         *
         * PM01's interrupt is the arbiter's own. The dts gives spmi@c440000
         * interrupts-extended = <0x62 0x01 0x04> - PDC pin 1 - and 512 + 1 is
         * 513 = 0x201, which all 21 PMIC-GPIO nodes in the corpus carry, Level,
         * ActiveHigh, Shared, except Kailua and Waipio, whose PMIC on PDC pin 3
         * adds a second. gauguin has no PMIC on pin 3.
         *
         * PM01._DSM: the GPIO Controller UUID, function 0 returning the bitmap
         * 0x03 (functions 1 and 2), function 1 returning the platform's own
         * PON key indices. The UUID and the bitmap are constant across every
         * table that carries them, and the pair at function 1 is not: it is
         * 0x07,0x06 in ten tables and Zero,One in ten others, twenty in all.
         * Its meaning was open until this step and is now measured. It is
         * <kpdpwr, resin>, the two PON index numbers the platform's power-on
         * block gives those keys, and the measurement is a coincidence that
         * cannot be one: in every one of those twenty tables the package at
         * function 1 is exactly the pair the same table's BTNS node lists as
         * pins[0] and pins[2] - twenty of twenty, both fields, no exception.
         * The device trees read from the other side the same way: lisa's
         * pon_hlos@1300 names its two interrupts kpdpwr and resin at indices 7
         * and 6, miatoll's qcom,power-on@800 names the same two at 0 and 1, and
         * those are the two pairs the ACPI tables split into.
         *
         * gauguin's are 0 and 1, from its own pm6350 pon@800: pwrkey takes
         * interrupt index 0, resin index 1, both enabled. The tempting pair is
         * 7 and 6 - it is the one this file carried until this step, it is the
         * one the SM8350 family states, and gauguin has a block that states it
         * too, the pmk8350's pon@1300 - but both of that block's keys are
         * status = "disabled" in gauguin.dts, and pm6350 at SPMI USID 0 is the
         * PMIC the board boots from. Four older tables return Buffer
         * (One){0x00} at function 1 instead, and those are all pre-0A families.
         *
         * _STA returning 0x0F is this file's convention on every device it
         * defines; the reference tables leave it out and are present by default.
         *
         * Deliberately not added here, with the reason each time. PMAP was the
         * first entry on this list and is no longer on it: its _DEP is a
         * three-entry package naming \_SB.PMIC, \_SB.ABD and \_SB.SCM0, two of
         * which were absent from this file when that was written, so it would
         * have been a dangling dependency. Steps 4.75 and 4.76 wrote ABD and
         * SCM0, the last referent arrived, and Step 4.77 wrote the node; its
         * own comment, below, carries the id and the GEPT that three sibling
         * nodes share.
         *
         *   PMBM and PMGK are in the corpus, and no id of either is claimed by
         * the 7280 set - eight ids over 17 declarations and five over 11, with
         * QCOM0A2A and QCOM0A8E the two the lisa/a52sxq pair writes - so
         * adding them would put two devices in Device Manager that nothing
         * binds. PML0 (QCOM0AD3, which qcpmic7280.inf does claim) is
         * reachable, but it is an I2C-attached PMIC - lisa's _CRS gives it
         * four I2C addresses on \_SB.I2C2 - and this file has no I2C
         * controller and gauguin's pm8008 is at a different address. PEP0
         * (QCOM0A17, qcpep.wd7280.inf) is claimed and is the largest remaining
         * single node in the reference, 2,501 lines in lisa - but only 629 of
         * those are skeleton, the rest is one case per thermal zone, and it is
         * the power engine besides: its own step, and its own comment above
         * carries the measurement.

        //     which leaves the board's cell as the only third opinion, and it
        //     says Level, which sides with QCOM1AC2. This is the second time in

        //     majority - 4.72 recorded the SMMU pair's Edge against this

        // _PSV, which lisa sets to 0x0EC4: nothing on this board names that
        // block, so there is no measurement here that would put a temperature
        // on it. _CRT is the opposite case - lisa writes it only on its PMIC
        // group, but every one of gauguin's SoC zones carries a reset-mon-cfg
        // trip at 115000, which is 0x0F28, which is the number lisa's PMIC
        // group already uses; it is written here on the board's evidence.
        //
        // _TC1, _TC2, _TSP, _MTL and _TZP are the family's, because they are
        // coefficients and periods with no counterpart on either side of the
        // join, and the driver's thermal engine reads them as policy.
        //
        // _TZD is written on three zones and withheld from ten, and both halves
        // are measured at each zone's own (id, _UID) pair. lisa's UID-One zones
        // - 0A58, 0A59 and 0AD4, which are this table's TZ1, TZ3 and TZ5 - carry
        // `Name (_TZD, Package (0x01) { \_SB.PEP0 })`, and so do both other
        // tables that declare that pair, so those three get it. The other ten
        // either carry no _TZD at all - 0A51, 0A4C, 0A4B and both UID-Zero
        // halves of the UID-One pairs - or name devices this table has not got:
        // 0A91 names \_SB.GPU0, 0A92 names \_SB.MJCT, 0ABF names \_SB.CSW0 and
        // 0A57 names \_SB.WLTM, \_SB.CSW0 and \_SB.GPU0 together. A _TZD that
        // names a device this table does not have is worse than no _TZD.
        //
        // _DEP is written now that its referent exists. Twelve of the thirteen
        // zones carry `Method (_DEP) { Return (Package (0x01) { \_SB.PEP0 }) }`
        // - the form and the entry every corpus zone at those (id, _UID) pairs
        // uses, and the line the QUP engines, the QGP nodes and the two SMMUs
        // were each waiting on for the same reason. The thirteenth is TZ13,
        // whose corpus form is `{ \_SB.PEP0, \_SB.BCL1 }`: this table has no
        // BCL1, and a _DEP that evaluates to AE_NOT_FOUND is worth what no _DEP
        // is worth while costing more to read, so it is the one zone left
        // without. (This used to read "a one-entry _DEP is a shape no table
        // has", which Step 4.75 falsified - see the ABD node above.)
        //
        // Four groups are deliberately not here yet, and each is its own
        // measurement: the PMIC group 0AC8/0AC9/0ACB, which is the only one
        // whose _DEP has two entries and the only one with a _DSM and a GpioInt
        // _CRS on \\_SB.PM01 pin 0x00C0; the ADC group 0A5F/0A61/0A63, which
        // _DEPs two devices this table has not got; TZ99 0A5A, whose _TZD is a
        // 13-entry package naming five containers and which is the one zone
        // that summarizes the others; and the nine 04C0-04C8 the modem's own
        // qcthermalmdm7280.inf binds, which the modem cannot be driven from.

        // The high byte is never different between the two ids of a row, and the
        // low byte never crosses between the groups: GLNK 84 goes with IPC0 0D,
        // 8D with 0E, and F9 with 1C, and no table departs from its row. So the
        // transport and the router are issued as a pair the way RPEN and PILC are
        // (06E1 and 06E0) - and unlike those two the pairing carries no
        // generation of its own, because there is no IPC0 whose high byte differs
        // from its own GLNK's. QGP0 and QGP1 are the third index over the same
        // nine generations and they partition them the same way - 93 for 05/08/14,
        // 88 for 09/0A/0C/1A/25, F4 for 02 - so three indices now agree on the
        // families. They do not agree on the offset between them: 93 to 8D is six
        // and 88 to 84 is four and F4 to F9 goes the other way by five. The
        // family is a property of the table and the spacing between the indices
        // is not.
        //
        // With the generation fixed at 0A by QGP0 and QGP1's QCOM0A88, the row is
        // the only one that matters here, and both halves of it are written: 0A84
        // was GLNK's, in Step 4.82, and 0A0D is this node's. The corpus's only
        // two 0A tables, a52sxq and lisa, both write it. The driver set agrees
        // and agrees only that far, which is the shape the GLNK comment already
        // records: of the nine IPC0 ids exactly one appears anywhere in the 112
        // infs, QCOM0A0D in qcipcrouter7280.inf, and of the nine GLNK ids exactly
        // one does, QCOM0A84 in qcglink7280.inf. The drivers claim one generation
        // out of nine and it is the one QGP0 had already put this table in.

        // The body is the smallest of any node this file has written: a _DEP
        // naming \_SB.GLNK alone in all twenty-one, an _HID, and the alias. No
        // _UID anywhere in the corpus - none in twenty-one, where the GLNK above
        // it has one in twenty-one - and no _CRS in any table, including the nine
        // where GLNK carries nine Interrupt descriptors. Those nine are the
        // transport's own lines and they stay on the transport. No _STA but the
        // same two tables, vili and Waipio. The alias in twenty and Waipio's
        // Method (_SUB) in the twenty-first: that is the second node in a row
        // where Waipio is the only departure, and with _STA it makes three
        // members on which this board and vili's are the corpus's whole
        // disagreement about this node.
        //
        // Position: the corpus agrees on what follows this node and not on what
        // precedes it. Immediately after it, in 21 of 21, is GLNK. Immediately
        // before it there is no agreement at all - RP1 in 14 tables, GIO0 in 3,
        // QPPX in 2, and RPEN and IPCC in one each - so the run is anchored at its
        // bottom and not its top. Three unanimous relations pin the slot exactly.
        // RPEN precedes IPC0 in 21 of 21 and PILC in 19 of 19, the two tables
        // without a PILC being vili and Waipio, the same two as everywhere else;
        // GLNK follows it in 21 of 21. In this file RPEN, PILC and GLNK are
        // consecutive, so of the two slots those relations allow - above PILC or
        // below it - only the second survives, and this node lands between PILC
        // and GLNK, which is where the GLNK comment said it would land and for
        // the reason it gave. Twenty-four unanimous relations are satisfied by
        // that slot, one more than GLNK's slot satisfied on its own, the
        // difference being the GLNK relation this node now supplies. Not one of
        // the six GLNK's slot breaks is repaired, and they are the same six by
        // name: MMU0 and MMU1 (20 of 20) sit above IPC0 in the corpus and below
        // it here, and UCS0 (10 of 10), UFN0, URS0 and USB0 (20 each) sit below
        // it and above it here. The cause is the early block this file wrote in
        // an order of its own; a reordering is its own measurement, so they are
        // recorded and not repaired, as at RPEN and PILC and GLNK.
        //
        // Three nodes the corpus puts before IPC0 in every table that has both
        // were not in this table when that paragraph was written - BAM1 and BAM5
        // (21 of 21) and TFTP (21 of 21) - and the prediction made here was that
        // TFTP would be written above this node and not below it. It was written
        // in Step 4.84 and it landed above, but the prediction was coarse: the
        // corpus puts PILC before TFTP in 19 of 19 tables that have both, so the
        // slot is not the one above IPC0's other side but the one between PILC
        // and this node. On the 602 table-votes TFTP's relations carry that slot
        // scores 491 and is the unique maximum; the runner-up scores 472 and
        // loses PILC's 19. The adjacency predicted here is unchanged - TFTP is
        // immediately before this node in this file now, and IPC0 is still
        // immediately before GLNK, which is the adjacency the corpus does state,
        // 21 of 21. BAM1 and BAM5 are still absent and their constraint is
        // unchanged and now sharper: they precede both TFTP and this node in 21
        // of 21, so whichever of the two slots they take, they take it above.

        // The id. Twenty-one tables declare a GLNK, under nine ids: QCOM058D five

        // and F9 in one (02) - the same three-way grouping QGP0's comment
        // measured on its own index, 88/93/F4, which is a second sighting of the
        // families and not a coincidence.
        //
        // What settles the id is this table's own four, and the shape of the
        // argument is the hardest form of the standing rule so far. This table
        // already writes PILC QCOM06E0, RPEN QCOM06E1, IPCC QCOM06C2 and QGP0 and
        // QGP1 QCOM0A88. Six corpus tables write the first three of those
        // together - a52sxq, lisa, renoir, Cedros' IDP, and Kailua's MTP and QRD
        // - and they split three ways on GLNK:
        //
        //   a52sxq, lisa                   IDP07280      QCOM0A84

        //
        // Two tables each, and Waipio - the seventh table whose RPEN is 06E1 and
        // whose IPCC is 06C2, and the one table of the seven with no PILC - is a
        // third vote for 0C84. Six tables with byte-identical service ids carry
        // three different transport ids, so the service series does not determine
        // the transport series; the table owns both and numbers them apart. That
        // is why this id could not be read off as "the generation after 06", the
        // way RPEN's could not be counted up from PILC's.
        //
        // The fourth id already here decides it. QGP0 and QGP1 are QCOM0A88, and
        // 0A is in the 88 group with 09, 0C, 1A and 25, so this table's QUP-side
        // family was fixed at 0A when those two nodes were written - by the same
        // driver-set argument QGP0's comment records at length. Within 0A there
        // is one GLNK id in the corpus and both of its tables write it: QCOM0A84.
        // The driver set agrees twice rather than once, because the pair is
        // claimed whole: qcglink7280.inf takes ACPI\QCOM0A84 and
        // qcipcrouter7280.inf takes ACPI\QCOM0A0D, and those two are the only
        // 0A-generation ids anywhere in the 112 infs - 0A0D being the next node's
        // and not written here. So the corpus and the drivers both put this node
        // in 0A, and they are two measurements of one thing rather than one
        // measurement repeated.
        //
        // The body is the corpus's, and its shape is one switch with three
        // symptoms. Nine of the twenty-one carry a Method (_CRS) returning nine
        // Interrupt descriptors - eight Edge, one Level - and a one-entry _DEP
        // naming \_SB.RPEN alone; twelve carry no _CRS at all and a two-entry
        // _DEP naming \_SB.IPCC and \_SB.RPEN. The two properties are not merely
        // correlated but coincident: the nine with the resource list are exactly
        // the nine tables that declare no IPCC device, and the twelve without one
        // are exactly the twelve that do. And the same line divides the
        // generations - 02, 05, 08 and 14 on one side, 09, 0A, 0C, 1A and 25 on
        // the other - so the block changed shape once, in the same generation
        // step that added the IPCC node to these tables. This table is on the
        // newer side and this node takes the newer form: the _DEP written and the
        // _CRS not. The withheld resource is withheld for a better reason than
        // the QGP interrupts were: there is no family-0A GLNK _CRS to copy, and
        // the nine that exist are on GIC lines belonging to other boards.
        //
        // _UID is Zero in all twenty-one, as it is on UFS0, URS0, ABD and GIO0
        // here. So is the alias, in all twenty-one - twenty as
        // Alias (\_SB.PSUB, _SUB) and one, Waipio, as the Method (_SUB) form the
        // PEP0 comment records as that board's habit. No _STA: the two tables
        // that carry one are vili and Waipio, and they are also the two tables
        // that write a GLNK _STA on a table whose RPEN has no PILC beside it.
        // That is left as the observation it is.
        //
        // Position, and it is forced by two relations rather than fixed by many.
        // Before: UFS0, DEV0, ABD, PMIC and PM01 (21 of 21 each), PMAP and PRTC
        // (20), the four-wire ports (10), PML0 (11), I2C8 (9) and I2C9 (3), and
        // then the two
        // nodes above - RPEN (21 of 21) and PILC (19 of 19). After: QGP0 (19 of
        // 19) and QGP1 (21 of 21), then CPU0 to CPU3 (21 each) and CPU4 to CPU7
        // (19 each). All twenty-three of those unanimous relations are satisfied
        // by one slot, and it is the only slot that satisfies them: PILC is above
        // it and QGP0 is below it and the two are adjacent in this file, so the
        // choice here is this node or no position at all. Two relations the
        // corpus nearly agrees on are broken by that slot and are recorded rather
        // than repaired - SCM0 precedes GLNK in 20 of 21 and IPCC in 11 of 12,
        // and this file placed both after it, SCM0 in Step 4.71 and IPCC in 4.73.
        // Six more are unsatisfiable in any slot, and they are the same six the
        // PILC and RPEN comments record: UCS0 (10 of 10), URS0, USB0, UFN0, MMU0
        // and MMU1 (20 each) sit on the far side of GLNK in the corpus and on the
        // near side here, because this file wrote its early block in an order
        // that is not the corpus's.
        //
        // The one thing this slot cannot reproduce is the adjacency it was
        // measured on: the corpus puts GLNK immediately after IPC0 in all
        // twenty-one tables. IPC0 was written in Step 4.83 and landed between
        // PILC and this node, as predicted here, because three unanimous
        // relations leave no other slot - RPEN before it (21 of 21), PILC before
        // it (19 of 19) and GLNK after it (21 of 21) against this file's
        // consecutive RPEN, PILC and GLNK. The prediction was right and it was
        // also short: it counted two relations where the corpus has three, and
        // it did not know that the six relations this slot breaks are the same
        // six by name. That is recorded on IPC0's own comment, not here.

        // calls it QCOM0A0E, an SPI engine, and names it SP14; a52sxq calls the
        // same slot QCOM0A10, an I2C engine, and names it IC14. So the slot
        // identifies the engine and the protocol is the board's, which is
        // exactly what Step 4.70 found on gauguin when the board's tree and the
        // payload's disagreed about two addresses - except that here two
        // shipping boards disagree about one, and the family has been doing
        // this all along. It is also why the letter in an engine's name is the
        // protocol and not the slot: gauguin's two live SPI engines are slots 1
        // and 10 and would be SP1 and SP10, and lisa's SP14 is a52sxq's IC14.
        //
        // The id is QCOM0A88, and the family evidence is broad rather than a
        // pair for once: 20 of the 66 tables declare a QGP device, under nine
        // distinct ids, and the same block is indexed 88 in five families (09,
        // 0A, 0C, 1A, 25), 93 in three (05, 08, 14) and F4 in one (02) - so
        // the index is a property of the family generation and not a constant,
        // and 0A sits in the 88 group. It is claimed outright:
        //
        //   qcgpi7280.inf -> %QCGPI.DeviceDesc%=QCGPI_Device, ACPI\QCOM0A88
        //
        // The resources are the derivation and not a copy, which is why the
        // family's exact numbers are correct here. The board gives each
        // controller a 0x60000 region named "gpi-top" - reg = <0x800000
        // 0x60000> and <0x900000 0x60000> - and the corpus's _CRS is that
        // region less its first 0x4000: 0x50000 long from base + 0x4000, on
        // lisa and on a52sxq alike. Both of gauguin's regions are 0x60000, so
        // the same subtraction gives the same window, and the GPI TOP block
        // the family steps over is the first 0x4000 of a region whose name
        // says it is there.
        //
        // The interrupts do not transfer, and this is the one place in the
        // block where the corpus's values would have been wrong. Each board
        // declares the controller ten interrupt lines - qcom,max-num-gpii = 10
        // on both - and gauguin's are 0x114 through 0x11D on wrapper 0 and
        // 0x2A5 through 0x2AE on wrapper 1. The family declares two of them on
        // both its controllers, and at wrapper 0 those two are gauguin's first
        // two to the digit, 0x114 and 0x115, which is why the family's count is
        // kept and only its numbers are replaced. At wrapper 1 lisa's two are
        // its own lines, 0x137 and 0x138, and gauguin's are 0x2A5 and 0x2A6:
        // the numbering agrees between the two SoCs for the whole wrapper-0
        // ladder and disagrees completely at wrapper 1, and nothing here
        // explains the split, so both numbers are measured rather than argued.
        // qcom,gpii-mask says how many of the ten are instantiated on this
        // board - 0x1F, five, on wrapper 0 and 0x3F, six, on wrapper 1 - and
        // the two the family declares are inside both masks.
        //
        // Neither node carries _DEP: the family's QGP nodes have none, and the
        // dependency runs the other way, from a QUP engine to its GPI DMA. The
        // family's record of that direction is real but not uniform. Three
        // engines per table carry it, and the controller each names is its own
        // wrapper's - the same pairing gauguin's dmas show:
        //
        //   lisa    I2C2 (slot 2)  _DEP {PEP0, QGP0, MMU0}
        //           I2C5 (slot 5)  _DEP {PEP0, QGP0}
        //           SP14 (slot 14) _DEP {PEP0, QGP1, MMU0}
        //
        //   a52sxq  I2C2 (slot 2)  _DEP {PEP0, QGP0, MMU0}
        //           I2C4 (slot 4)  _DEP {PEP0, QGP0}
        //           IC14 (slot 14) _DEP {PEP0, QGP1, MMU0}
        //
        // - and the third entry, MMU0, is on two of the three and not on the
        // third in both tables, so the family's _DEP is not a uniform statement
        // about this hardware and is not a complete one either: gauguin's dmas
        // put all five live engines on a controller where the family records
        // three.
        //
        // The UARTs take the same kind of entry and a shorter one. Across the 34
        // UART nodes the corpus carries, 31 write _DEP {PEP0} alone - lisa's
        // UARD and UAR8, a52sxq's, alioth's, and the rest of the family - three
        // write {PEP0, MMU0}, the UAR4 of a52q, miatoll and surya and the only
        // UART _DEP in the corpus with two entries, and none writes none at all.
        // Six of the 31 write the package width as One rather than 0x01 -
        // caymanslm's two and pipa's four - which is how a first pass here,
        // reading only 0xNN widths, came to count six nodes as having no _DEP
        // before Step 4.86 re-read them. GIO0 never appears in one. This file
        // said it did - "both tables' UARD carries {PEP0, GIO0}" stood here until
        // Step 4.86 counted the 34 - and what named GIO0 was the GpioInt in the
        // UART's _CRS, which 30 of the 34 carry, lisa's UAR8 on pin 0x1F and
        // lisa's UARD on 0x17, the four that do not being pipa's UARD, UR14,
        // UR18 and UR20. A _CRS resource is not a dependency, and the
        // correction is recorded rather than quietly made. GIO0 does carry _DEP
        // entries elsewhere in the family - {GIO0, PEP0, SPI5} on TSC1 in three
        // tables, {GIO0, PEP0, SPI1} on surya's TSC1 in one, {GIO0, I2C4} on
        // four tables' speaker amps, {AFT1, GIO0, IC10} on miatoll's SPK1 - so
        // the reference would be writable here, this table having declared GIO0
        // as its twelfth device. It is not written, and that is now a decision
        // reached on its own rather than a consequence of a missing referent:
        // PEP0 landed in Step 4.93 and this table's UART _DEP was written in
        // Step 4.94, while GIO0 is still left out because no UART node in the
        // corpus names a GPIO controller in a _DEP at all - zero of the
        // thirty-four - so adding one here would be this table's invention and
        // not the family's.
        //
        //   The counts in that sentence stood as "three", "three" and "one" and
        //   named SPI1 for the shape SPI5 carries, until Step 4.94 re-measured
        //   them; the sets and the nodes it names agree and the counts did not.
        //   The UART denominator read thirty-eight there and is thirty-four.
        //   Same reading as everywhere else in this file now:
        //   `tools/acpi-dep-census.py`.
        //
        // This table wrote no engine _DEP until Step 4.94, for the same reason
        // the IC nodes above did not: every family shape here needs PEP0, the
        // entries the family writes beside it - GIO0's, MMU0's - are the
        // family's second and third entries rather than entries of their own,
        // and one alone would have been a shape no engine in the corpus writes.
        // That last half of the reason was wrong and Step 4.94 measured it: an
        // engine _DEP with PEP0 alone is the family's commonest shape by far,
        // 43 of the 55 I2C/IC nodes and 31 of the 34 UART nodes. The first half
        // was right and is what made the entry unwritable until PEP0 landed.
        //
        // The counts, re-measured in Step 4.94 over every generation of every
        // node name rather than over the one id this board binds - which is
        // what Step 4.93's numbers had been, and why SCM0 read there as a bare
        // majority when it is not one:
        //
        //   protocol    nodes   {PEP0}   none   other   QGP tail   MMU0 entry
        //   I2C / IC      55       43      3       9         8           5
        //   SPI / SP      17        0      0      17        17          16
        //   UART          34       31      0       3         0           3
        //
        // So the shape follows the protocol rather than the address, and it has
        // a reading: an SPI transfer is bulk and wants the DMA, an I2C or UART
        // transfer is small enough for the FIFO path, and every SPI engine in
        // the corpus names its GPI DMA while 43 of 55 I2C/IC engines and 31 of
        // 34 UARTs name nothing but PEP0. This table's four engines are three
        // I2C and one I2C-mode UART, so all four take the one-entry form.
        //
        //   A correction, and this is the third reading of these counts in one
        //   step. The table above stood as "I2C / IC 53 43 8 5" and "UART 38 35
        //   0 3" in the first draft of this comment, and the prose two
        //   paragraphs up stood as "52 of the 53 I2C nodes and 38 of 38 UART
        //   nodes". The three disagree, which is itself the finding: only one of
        //   them can have been a reading of the corpus, and one of the two that
        //   were written into this file was not. The numbers above are over the
        //   65 reference tables with this one left out, which is what
        //   `tools/acpi-dep-census.py` prints by default - the tool is in the
        //   repository so the question can be asked again rather than
        //   remembered, which is the rule `acpi-hid-census.disassemble` states
        //   for every other number in this file. `--keep-self` prints the
        //   framing that counts this table among the corpus, and it moves every
        //   total by this table's own four engines - 58 and 46, and 35 and 32 -
        //   which is the difference a census has to name before it can be one.
        //
        // The QGP tail is left out on that reading and not on a vote, and the
        // difference matters for whichever step adds it. Where it appears the
        // corpus gives no rule for when: lisa's and a52sxq's I2C4 are the same
        // node at the same address, 0x98C000, and one writes {PEP0, QGP0} while
        // the other writes {PEP0}; in a52sxq the engines at 0x984000 and
        // 0x98C000 name a QGP while the one at 0x994000 between them names
        // none. The board's own tree does settle which controller each of this
        // table's three would name - dmas = <0x4b 0x00 0x01 0x03 ...> on
        // i2c@984000 and its two siblings, phandle 0x4b being dma-controller@
        // 900000, which this table calls QGP1 - and the corpus agrees with that
        // attribution wherever it is checked, by the rule that the engine names
        // the QGP whose base is the nearest at or below its own: 8 I2C nodes
        // over 5 distinct engine names in 4 tables, every one of them naming a
        // controller below its own base. The rule is a rule and not a law, and
        // Step 4.94 found the one place it does not hold: pipa's SPI4 sits at
        // 0x88C000 and names QGP0 at 0x904000, above it, while its four
        // siblings at the same address name QGP0 at 0x804000. It is recorded
        // here because it is the derivation a later step needs, and withheld
        // because of what the entry does rather than what it says: a _DEP on
        // QGP1 holds the engine's driver until qcgpi7280 binds, and if that
        // driver never binds the engine is held with it, where {PEP0} alone
        // asks only for the power engine without which the engine cannot run at
        // all. (This sentence read "in all five of its I2C nodes that name one"
        // before the re-measurement; there are 8, and five is the number of
        // distinct node names among them.)
        //
        // The same census closes eight other nodes in this file for good, and
        // they are worth naming once because each of their own comments
        // describes a missing entry and each of those descriptions is now a
        // measurement rather than a deferral. Counted over every generation of
        // the name: SPMI 22 of 22 declare no _DEP, BAM1 21 of 21, GIO0 21 of 21,
        // RPEN 21 of 21, QGP1 21 of 21, PILC 19 of 19, QGP0 19 of 19 and AGR0
        // 20 of 20. Not one node of any of those eight names carries a _DEP in
        // any table of the corpus - the ids change from generation to
        // generation and the emptiness does not - so their entries are absent
        // because the family writes them absent, and not because anything was
        // missing here. None of them changes in Step 4.94.
        //
        // Step 4.93 landed PEP0, so the referent is present and the entries are
        // written as of Step 4.94. What they had been waiting on was counted
        // wrong in Step 4.93 and the correction is the interesting part: the
        // UARTs were already settled (UAR8 at 4 of 4 and UARD at 13 of 13,
        // every one of them {PEP0}), the SPI nodes were not split at all (five
        // nodes named SP12, SP14, SP18 and SP19 - and all five write {PEP0,
        // QGPn, MMU0}, the QGP number following the table's own inventory), and
        // the two counts that really were splits - MMU0 at 11 {PEP0} against 9
        // {MMU1}, SCM0 at 11 {PEP0} against 10 with none at all - both resolve
        // by _HID rather than by vote: MMU0's nine are QCOM0212, QCOM0509,
        // QCOM0809 and QCOM1409 and this board's QCOM0A09 is not among them,
        // and SCM0's ten are nine tables at four other ids plus the one table
        // in the corpus with no PEP0 in it.
        // The consequence is worth stating rather than hiding - qci2c7280.inf
        // and qcgpi7280.inf are both in the Windows driver set, so nothing in
        // this table orders the GPI DMA ahead of the engines that DMA for it,
        // and Step 4.94 chose that deliberately against the board's own wiring:
        // every one of the four engines the step gave a _DEP is reachable over
        // FIFO and none of them runs a bulk transfer, so the DMA edge buys
        // ordering this table cannot yet test and can cost the engine its start
        // if qcgpi7280 never binds. The paragraph above carries the derivation
        // the step that adds it will need.
        // Neither QGP node carries _STA either; both nodes in the board's tree
        // are ok and a52sxq's QGP0 and QGP1 are literally byte-identical in the
        // two tables of that family, so there is nothing about this block for a
        // _STA to disagree with. What is deliberately not here is the SMMU:
        // gauguin's controllers sit behind it (iommus = <&apps_smmu 0x56 0> and
        // <&apps_smmu 0x4D6 0>, and phandle 0x17 is apps-smmu@15000000) and
        // every family _DEP that names the GPI DMA names MMU0 beside it, but
        // the family's QGP nodes do not describe it. What would is MMU0, and
        // this table has it as of Step 4.72, two nodes below, with MMU1; both
        // halves of that reference now resolve, and the engines that name one
        // name PEP0 and nothing else.

                 * The hub and its one port, which is where the port's `_UPC`
                 * and `_PLD` belong. `_UPC` is defined for the `_ADR` child of a
                 * USB host controller whose address is the port number, and that
                 * child is `PRT1`; on `USB0` itself it was answering a question
                 * nothing asks, and the controller had no port device for
                 * Windows to attach a port to. The move is not a rewrite: the
                 * blob below is byte-identical to the one that stood on `USB0`
                 * and on `UFN0` until Step 4.90, and all that step did was take
                 * it off the two controllers.
                 *
                 * Nothing here needs an id, so nothing here needs the driver set
                 * checked - the same position `BTNS` is in, for the opposite
                 * reason: there the operating system supplies the driver, here
                 * the address is the identity. Both members are `_ADR`-addressed
                 * children of a device this file already writes.
                 *
                 * The shape is 20 of the 65 tables - 21 of 66 if this table is
                 * counted among them, which below it is not - and unanimous
                 * among the 20: every one carries an `RHUB` under `URS0`'s
                 * `USB0` and a second under `URS0`'s `UFN0`, each with exactly
                 * one `PRT1`. 44 tables declare neither device, and 42 of those
                 * name neither one either; the two that do are Kailua's, which
                 * name a `PRT1` only as an `External`, under a `UBF0` whose
                 * table the corpus does not hold.
                 *
                 * The bodies are measured rather than assumed. `RHUB`'s own body
                 * is one member, `Name (_ADR, Zero)`, in 58 of its 60
                 * occurrences, and `PRT1`'s is three - `_ADR One`, `_UPC`, `_PLD`
                 * - in 58 of 59. The 59th `PRT1` is a52sxq's redriver: a
                 * top-level `Device (PRT1)` carrying `_HID "QCOM1121"`, sharing
                 * the name and nothing else, stating neither `_UPC` nor `_PLD`.
                 * The one table with a hub and no port is caymanslm, whose hub
                 * is also the corpus's only `RHUB` in a table that declares no
                 * port at all - its body holds a `_DSM` and three temporaries -
                 * but not the corpus's only body that is more than a bare
                 * `_ADR`: nabu carries a third `RHUB`, under a `USBD` that is
                 * neither of `URS0`'s children, and that one holds an `MP0` with
                 * an `XMKB` in it where the others hold a `PRT1`.
                 *
                 * `_UPC` is `Package (0x04) { One, 0x09, Zero, Zero }` in all 40
                 * instances under `URS0`. The eighteen under the `URS1`-ward
                 * controllers are not one value: twelve read the same 0x09, six
                 * read 0x06, and this table has no `URS1` at all, so none of the
                 * eighteen is a question this table is answering.
                 *
                 * `_PLD` is one blob everywhere and the field that moves is
                 * `PLD_GroupPosition`: 0x0 on all 40 `URS0` instances - named in
                 * 38 of them and read out of the twenty bytes in pipa's two,
                 * which state it as a raw `Buffer (0x14)` rather than through a
                 * `ToPLD` - against 0x1 on fourteen of the `URS1` instances and
                 * 0x3 on vayu's two and pipa's two. The only port in the corpus
                 * that states no `GroupPosition` is a52sxq's redriver, which is
                 * also the only one that states no `_UPC`. 0x0 is this
                 * subtree's, and it is what this node states.
                 *
                 * Where it sits is measured with a disagreement in it. Under
                 * `USB0` the node is the fourth member, after `_ADR`, `_S0W` and
                 * `_CRS`, in 18 of the 21 the corpus puts there - the same 18 of
                 * the 20 pair tables, caymanslm's being the twenty-first. The
                 * two that are not, b4q's and ingres's, put it last, after
                 * `PHYC`, and caymanslm's is last too. Under `UFN0` it is the
                 * third, between `_S0W` and `_CRS`, in 17 of the 20, with b4q
                 * and ingres last again and vili's fourth, after `_CRS`. The
                 * majority order is followed in each device, and the asymmetry
                 * between the two - hub fourth under `USB0`, third under
                 * `UFN0` - is the corpus's rather than a slip.
                 *
                 * Every number above is what `tools/acpi-usb-pair-census.py`
                 * prints for the 65 tables that are not this one, which is what
                 * Step 4.91 added here. Step 4.90 wrote this comment by hand and
                 * seven of its numbers do not survive the tool: the pair as "20
                 * of the 66", 43 tables declaring neither, 59 of 60 bare hubs,
                 * caymanslm's as the corpus's only non-bare body, 0x3 on vayu's
                 * two, pipa's four `_PLD` fields called absent - they are 0x0 and
                 * 0x3, and the field is in the bytes - and the two slot
                 * denominators, 20 and 19 where the corpus has 21 and 20. The
                 * shape it described was right and the arithmetic was not: a
                 * file scoring itself is not a measurement, and neither is a
                 * number nobody can re-derive.
                 *
                 * bitra is why this needs an argument. It has no `RHUB` and no
                 * `PRT1` - zero occurrences of either name - and carries `_UPC`
                 * and `_PLD` on `USB0` itself, which is the shape these two
                 * blocks came into this table in. The choice made here is the
                 * one Step 4.65 already made for `URS0._HID`: follow the
                 * generator group, family 0A, and not the SoC family, 04. Both
                 * of family 0A's tables, lisa's and a52sxq's, carry the pair,
                 * and neither of them carries it anywhere but in `PRT1`.

         * The Type-C controller. Of the nodes this table still owes P3 it is
         * the shortest to justify, and the best-attested: the node is 1,272
         * bytes and 46 lines in lisa, in a52sxq and in the SC7280 CRD's DSDT,
         * and the three are byte-identical to each other - zero differing
         * lines in either comparison. Two of them are iasl output for EDK2;
         * the third is creator `MSFT`, taken from a shipped Qualcomm UFS
         * firmware capsule (qcfirmware7280_UFS/qcfirmware7280v_UFS03600000.cap,
         * offset 0xb683a5, header `QCOMM `/`SDM7280 `, 85,861 bytes). The two
         * EDK2 tables are family 0A, the family that gave this file GIO0's
         * QCOM0A0C and URS0's QCOM0A8B, and the node is one id, one resource
         * and five accessors.
         *
         * `_HID` is "QCOM0AA4" and the family byte is what settles it, the
         * same way it settled GIO0's, the PMIC-GPIO node below. The suffix is not
         * fixed across blocks and generations - it is 17 for the PEP, 0C for
         * the TLMM, 8B for the URS controller and A4 for this one, and A4 is
         * not even constant for this block: the Atoll and SM7325 tables spell
         * it A9 (a52q's and miatoll's QCOM08A9, surya's QCOM14A9) while
         * SDM7350 uses A4 (renoir's and Cedros_IDP's QCOM09A4). gauguin has
         * no SDM7350 to follow and no Atoll to follow; it has lisa and
         * a52sxq. And the id is claimed, which is the check the header above
         * asks for: `tools/acpi-hid-census.py --drivers DIR --bind QCOM0AA4`
         * reports qcusbcucsi7280/qcusbcucsi7280.inf, whose INF binds
         * `ACPI\QCOM0AA4` to `qcusbcucsi7280.sys` and carries the
         * `HKR,Resources,"BinaryPath",%REG_SZ%, %13%\UCS0.bin` line that
         * hands the driver its own firmware blob.
         *
         * `_DEP` was deliberately absent until Step 4.93 wrote it, and it was
         * the one place this node did not copy lisa. lisa's reads
         * `Package (One) { \_SB.PEP0 }`, and
         * PEP0 is the power engine: 2,501 lines and 96,100 bytes in lisa, and
         * the same size in a52sxq's with exactly two lines differing - both in
         * `_SUB`, which returns `"CRD07280"` on lisa and `"QRD07280"` on
         * a52sxq from a branch keyed on `\_SB.PSUB`. That is generator output
         * with a reference-platform string in it and not board data, and it is
         * the sort of thing a port has to notice: this table's own PSUB is
         * `"MTP07225"`, so lisa's `_SUB` verbatim would have fallen off the end
         * of both branches and answered zero. PEP0 is dominated by one method of
         * its own, and the domination is measurable rather than rhetorical:
         * `THTZ` is a dispatch on (zone, trip point) and is 1,826 of lisa's
         * 2,501 lines, and the node's total is a linear function of the number
         * of zones that dispatch covers - 32 cases in lisa, 24 in venus and
         * vili, and a shipped zero-zone PEP0 of 629 lines in
         * Silicon-Qualcomm-Kailua-DSDT_MTP whose whole `THTZ` is
         * `Return (0xFFFF)`. Nothing in any of the 20 tables that declare
         * `THTZ` calls it, so it is an interface for the OS side and not
         * internal logic. Its `_DEP` names `\_SB.IPCC`, and its skeleton also
         * reaches `\_SB.ABD.ROP1` and `\_SB.AGR0`; none of the three was in
         * this table when this node was written, and all three are now - AGR0
         * from this step. Naming it before it landed would have put
         * a reference into the namespace that could not resolve, and an `_DEP`
         * that evaluates to AE_NOT_FOUND is worth exactly what no `_DEP` is
         * worth while costing more to read: a later step would meet it as a
         * dangling name rather than as a node known to be missing. `_DEP` is
         * advisory start ordering and there was nothing here to order against.
         * Step 4.93 landed PEP0 and wrote the line this paragraph used to
         * reserve - `Name (_DEP, Package (One) { \_SB.PEP0 })` - together with
         * the matching one on URS0, which now carries
         * `Package (0x02) { \_SB.PEP0, \_SB.UCS0 }` because lisa's URS0
         * depends on both and this table's URS0 is the same node.
         *
         * `_CRS` is one `GpioIo` on GIO0 pin 0x23. That makes it the first
         * GpioIo this table has placed on GIO0 - everything on that node so
         * far is Interrupt-only - which is precisely the condition OFNI's
         * header names when it says 156 is inert only while nothing above 155
         * is addressed. 0x23 is 35, so the value does not move, and the
         * reason is not that 35 is small: the class extension validates a
         * GpioIo pin against OFNI, and 35 is inside 156 on any reading of
         * that value. The condition is now exercised rather than hypothetical.
         *
         * The five methods are one line each and all five return Names that
         * already sit in this scope above - MUXC, CCST, DPPN, HPDS and HIRQ.
         * They are how qcusbcucsi7280.sys reads the mux state, the CC state,
         * the DP pin assignment and the hotplug lines: for those the driver
         * does not touch a register, it calls into the namespace, and the
         * namespace is AML that something on the board side is expected to
         * keep current. lisa's node has no `_STA` and neither does this one,
         * so the node is present whenever the table is.
         *
         * "Something on the board side" is `IC11` in the SC7280 CRD, and it is
         * worth naming because it is why the five are constants here rather
         * than a defect in this node. IC11's interrupt handlers Q21 and Q22
         * read the PMIC's HPL0/HPH0 and write all five of these `_SB` values
         * out of them, then `Notify (\_SB.UCS0, 0xA0)`. This table has no
         * IC11, so nothing writes the five and the node answers five
         * constants, which is what the header above says. The id for that
         * missing engine is not a guess - `QCOM0A10`, claimed by
         * qci2c7280.inf, carried by exactly two of the 66 corpus tables, lisa
         * and a52sxq, the same pair that settled URS0's and this node's own
         * ids. Which engine it is on this board is still open, and gauguin's
         * tree has five I2C serial engines across two geniqup wrappers to
         * choose from.
         *
         * The far end is missing as well, and it is the end that matters more
         * than this one: this table has no `USBC000` device. In the CRD and
         * four other corpus tables that is `UBTC`, `_HID EisaId("USBC000")`
         * with `_CID PNP0CA0`, an MMIO mailbox, a child connector, and a `_DSM`
         * under the UUID `6f8398c2-7ca4-11e4-ad36-631042b5008f` - the same
         * string in every table that carries it. That is the ACPI UCSI device,
         * it is bound by Windows rather than by anything in the 7280 driver
         * set, and its `_DEP` names this node: `Package (0x03) { \_SB.IC11,
         * \_SB.GIO0, \_SB.UCS0 }`. So PEP0's field on `\_SB.ABD.ROP1`, the
         * `_DEP` this node cannot yet write, and the I2C addresses PML0 would
         * need all wait on one node, and docs/08's Step 4.68 has the
         * measurements for each of the three.

        // pm6350 pon@800 gives kpdpwr interrupt index 0 and resin index 1, both
        // enabled, and the pmk8350's pon@1300 pair of 7 and 6 is disabled on both
        // keys - so 0x0000 and 0x0001 here, the same two numbers the corrected
        // _DSM now states.
        //
        // Descriptor 1 is the volume-up key, and its number is the one value in
        // this node that rests on correlation rather than on measurement of the
        // same fact. gauguin's volume-up is pm6350's PMIC-GPIO 2: gpio-keys has
        // `gpios = <0xa0 0x02 0x01>`, phandle 0xa0 being `gpio@c000` inside the
        // pm6350 at SPMI USID 0, nine pins, and gpio 2's own pin state is
        // bias-pull-up - which is why the descriptor's fourth cell is PullUp. The
        // number in the pin list is not 2. PM01's pin namespace is flat and shared
        // by every device that hangs off it, and the GPIO blocks in it do not
        // start at zero: of the 22 BTNS tables, 16 name a volume-up whose
        // controller resolves in the device trees, and they carry exactly three
        // bases - 0x7F in six (pm8150@0 in five, pm8998@0 in one), 0xC0 in seven
        // (pm7325@1 in two, pm8350@1 in five) and 0x207 in three (pm6150l@4 in
        // three) - each being the ACPI number minus the controller-relative pin
        // that tree gives. The base tracks the SPMI slot rather than the model:
        // two different PMICs agree at slot 0 and two more at slot 1. gauguin's
        // block is pm6350 at slot 0, so the pin list says 0x7F + 2, which is
        // 0x0081.
        //
        // Step 4.215 bounds that number from the other side, and this is what it
        // added. Across the 21 paired tables the middle descriptor's pin is one the
        // PON also names in none of them: it is a third pin, outside the pair _DSM
        // function 1 states, everywhere in the corpus and not only here. It takes
        // six values - 0x00C6 in eight, 0x0085 in seven, 0x0209 in two, 0x00D5 in
        // two, 0x020F in one, and 0x0081 in one, the last of those being this file.
        // So the corpus cannot corroborate this number or refute it, because no
        // other table in it carries one; the reasoned part is the base (0x7F,
        // tracked to the SPMI slot rather than to the model) and not the
        // observation.
        //
        // The PMIC-GPIO node itself declares no pin range, and that is the shape
        // rather than a gap in this file: of the 22 corpus files that declare a
        // PM01, all 22 give it a _CRS and none declares a GpioIo or a GpioInt in it
        // - what they carry is one shared interrupt on 0x201, two of them in
        // Kailua's case. So the pin numbers the BTNS node indexes name a space no
        // ACPI table in this corpus describes in ACPI at all, which is why the base
        // above had to come from the device trees.
        //
        // That is a reasoned number, not a measured one, and the difference is
        // worth keeping visible. pm6350 appears in no corpus table and in no
        // device tree in this checkout but gauguin's; no INF in the 7280 set names
        // a pin; and the firmware tree carries no PMIC-GPIO pin-base table at all
        // - there is no `*PmicGpio*` file in it and no `pmicgpio`, `pm_gpio` or
        // `PmicGpio` string anywhere in it, the model appearing once, as
        // `EFI_PMIC_IS_PM6350 = 0x36` in EFIPmicVersion.h, with no numbering
        // beside it. If the base is a function of the model rather than of the
        // slot, the true number is something else and the volume-up key is the one
        // thing this node gets wrong; the other two descriptors are unaffected,
        // because their numbers are indices the PON itself states.
        //
        // The _DSD is copied rather than derived, and the measurement is what says
        // so. Its outer package is two elements - the Generic Buttons Device UUID
        // and one inner package of five-element entries - and the first four
        // entries are byte-identical in all 21 tables that carry three descriptors
        // - 20 until Step 4.215 counted them, the three-descriptor set being the 23
        // BTNS tables minus cepheus's four and caymanslm's five:
        // Zero One Zero One 0x0D; One Zero One One 0x81; One One One 0x0C 0xE9;
        // One 0x02 One 0x0C 0xEA. The pins those same tables list are not
        // identical at all - 0x0007/0x00C6/0x0006 in one, 0x0000/0x0085/0x0001 in
        // another, 0x0000/0x0209/0x0001 in a third. A blob that does not move when
        // the hardware does is the driver's table rather than the platform's, so it
        // is repeated here unchanged and its fields are not interpreted. The entry
        // count is one more than the descriptor count - four here, five in cepheus,
        // six in caymanslm - and those two tables' extra entries are the ones that
        // make it move.

        // about the board. gauguin's device tree has three adc@3100 blocks -
        // pm6150l's and pm7250b's, both qcom,spmi-adc5, at SPMI slots 4 and 2,
        // and pmk8350's, qcom,spmi-adc7, at slot 6 - but a DSDT device is the

        // driver package says the same thing in its own terms: it ships one
        // resource file, ADC1.bin, registered once, at HKR,0\Default_Resources.
        //
        // The twelve bytes of VUSR and VBTM cannot be read off this board, and
        // the reason belongs next to them. Nothing on the device states them:
        // all 107 partitions this device's own image set carries were scanned
        // for the DSDT signature and four hold the four letters without holding
        // a table - a kernel string in boot and in recovery, "DT/ACPI
        // DSDT/board file", an alphabetical run inside one of super's system
        // images, and two coincidences inside modem's code and its compressed
        // blobs - while every partition that could carry firmware does not
        // mention the word at all: abl, uefisecapp, xbl, tz, imagefv, toolsfv,
        // catefv, catecontentfv, vm-linux, qupfw, core_nhlos, dtbo, devcfg. So
        // there is no stock table to copy and no panel to read.
        // And the driver does not take them from ACPI first: it carries its own
        // per-board file and points at it, Resources_Dir = 13 with
        // Path = %13%\ADC1.bin. What is written here is therefore the corpus's,
        // and the corpus is what has to answer for it.
        //
        // What the corpus does with those bytes is measurable, and
        // tools/acpi-adc-blob-census.py is what measures it. 20 of the 65 tables
        // declare an ADC, 35 declarations in all, and the same seven bytes -
        // 8E 13 00 01 00 C1 02 - open all 70 twelve-byte buffers; bytes 7 and 8
        // are the two that move, and which of them travels with what is what the
        // variation answers rather than what this file assumes.
        //
        // Byte 7 travels with the pin pair, not with the instance's ordinal.
        // 0x00 goes with pins 0x0020/0x0028, 0x02 with 0x0130/0x0138 and 0x04
        // with 0x01D0/0x01D8 - and the two-ADC tables are what proves the
        // reading, because they have no middle pin pair and no middle value:
        // their second instance carries 0x04 where the three-ADC tables' second
        // carries 0x02. The value written here is 0x00 with the pair
        // 0x0020/0x0028, which is the first instance on all 18 tables that write
        // that pair. gauguin's three blocks sit at slots 2, 4 and 6 and no table
        // writes any of those, which is a second reason not to read the byte as
        // a slot.
        //
        // Byte 8 travels with the _HID and with nothing else in the 20 tables.
        // It is 0x31 in all 33 VUSR buffers, and in VBTM it is 0x34 on the nine
        // tables whose id is QCOM0221, QCOM0911, QCOM1A11 or QCOM0A11 against
        // 0x35 on the nine whose id is QCOM0512, QCOM0812, QCOM1412 or
        // QCOM2511. The split falls out by id and not by SoC, which matters
        // here: this board's own sibling table is bitra's, family 04, and it
        // declares no ADC at all. Kailua's two tables are the only others and
        // they write 0x90 and 0x91 on a different pin pair.
        //
        // So 0x34 is written, and it is not a coin flip between two numbers: it
        // is what both tables carrying this id write, and it is the one value
        // among the corpus's that this board's own tree also gives one of its
        // three blocks - 0x34 is pmk8350's adc-tm@3400 interrupt, where 0x35 is
        // the adc-tm@3500 of pm6150l's and pm7250b's, and 0x31, which all 33
        // VUSR buffers carry, is the adc@3100 interrupt of all three. That
        // correspondence is recorded and not leaned on: what either byte means
        // is not established here, the driver reads its own ADC1.bin, and this
        // blob is the platform's hint. 0x35 is what would be written instead if
        // the node were ever found to describe one of the PM6150-family blocks,
        // and the difference is one byte.
        //
        // The declared length does not close and is not repaired. Each buffer is
        // twelve bytes and opens 8E 13, so it states its own length as 0x13, 19;
        // each is then concatenated with the ten-byte NAM, "\\_SB.SPMI", to
        // build the object the driver is handed - 22 bytes against a declared
        // 19. All 35 declarations do that arithmetic the same way, 34 of them
        // through the four concatenations copied here and caymanslm through six,
        // with a third blob (FGRR) in the middle. A repair no table makes would
        // be this file's invention, so the four are copied and the arithmetic is
        // recorded as open.
        //
        // The two GPIO lines are the corpus's as well: 17 of the 20 write the
        // same pair, 0x0020 and 0x0028 on \_SB.PM01 with vendor data 0x02, and
        // the eighteenth is caymanslm, which adds a third at 0x0168. Kailua's
        // pair is 0x009F/0x00A0. The vendor data byte is repeated unchanged and
        // not interpreted, which is BTNS's rule for a blob that does not move
        // when the hardware does: 0x02 is one byte of a descriptor whose fields
        // nothing in this repository decodes.
        //
        // _STA returning 0x0F is this file's convention, recorded at ABD: it is
        // ACPI's own default, and saying it outright is what this file does on
        // the devices it defines. The corpus's two QCOM0A11 tables omit the
        // method and vili, the one ADC that writes one, returns 0x0F as well.
        // _UID is Zero, as on all 20 first instances, and there is no _ADR on
        // any of the 35 declarations - the device is id-addressed throughout the
        // corpus.

        // The _SUB alias is the corpus's \_SB.PSUB in all 35 declarations, which
        // is the same object this file spells ^PSUB on the 23 devices that hang
        // off _SB directly, this one among them; PMAP's comment has the rule.
        //
        // Where it goes is the corpus's answer too: the block is the last device
        // declared in all 20 tables, and in 10 of them the last declaration of
