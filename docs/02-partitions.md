# 02 — Partition map and backup

Every LUN on this device has been dumped to `~/backup/gauguin/images/`. The Smartisan R2
ROM currently installed is a `user/dev-keys` build with **no public image**, so these files
are the only copy that exists. Losing `super` or the small firmware LUNs means an
unrecoverable device.

All UFS LUNs here use **4096-byte logical sectors**, and several carry their GPT at a
non-zero byte offset within the LUN. Do not assume 512-byte sectors when parsing or
restoring them.

## What is in the backup

| Path (under `~/backup/gauguin/images/`) | Contents |
|---|---|
| `LUN-sdb.img` … `LUN-sdf.img` | whole-LUN dumps of the five small firmware LUNs. They include the GPT itself, so they are directly restorable. |
| `GPT-sda.bin` | the primary GPT of the big LUN (`sda`) |
| `part-<name>.img` | each `sda` partition except `userdata`, dumped by name |

`userdata` (107 GB of the 118 GB LUN) is deliberately **not** backed up — see the warning
at the end.

## `sda` — 118 GB, the OS LUN

### `boot` holds firmware, and 128 MB is why Windows arrives on a stick

`boot` is the one partition the standing relaxation allows writing, and what it is written
*with* is the UEFI payload — the `fastboot flash boot` image, 1,171,456 B at Step 4.155.
It is 128 MB, so it cannot also hold an OS: the smallest Microsoft-signed ARM64 Windows
image obtainable is the WinRE at 446,983,676 B, and with the ESP that boots it the medium is
481,626,167 B. Measured against this table, `boot`, `recovery` and `rawdump` (128 MB) miss by
325 MiB, `minidump` (96 MB) by 357, `cache` and `exaid` (384 MB) by 69, and the only two that
fit are `super` — the installed ROM, whose loss is unrecoverable — and `userdata`. So the
Windows media is external by design and is booted from a USB stick, which is why the UEFI's
USB host stack is a P3 item and not a later nicety. The medium itself is built by
`tools/p3-medium-build.sh`; see `docs/08-device-session.md`, Step 4.155, for the numbers.

## Restoring

The small-LUN dumps are byte-exact images including their partition tables, so a raw write
puts everything back:

```sh
fastboot flash xbl     ~/backup/gauguin/images/LUN-sdb.img
fastboot flash xblbak  ~/backup/gauguin/images/LUN-sdc.img
# sdd and sdf each hold several partitions; write them back as whole LUNs from
# fastbootd with dd, or extract individual partitions at the offsets listed above.
```

For `sda`, each partition was dumped individually, so:

```sh
fastboot flash <name> ~/backup/gauguin/images/part-<name>.img
```

**Do not repartition anything until a restore of at least one small partition has been
tested end to end.**

### The gap that was there, and the fix

The original backup dumped `sda` partition by partition and the five small LUNs whole. That
was a mistake for `sde`: it is a 1 GB LUN holding **62 partitions, including `boot`** — and
nothing carved `boot` out of it. So `boot` existed only as "somewhere inside `LUN-sde.img`
at LBA 162982", which is not a restore path anyone wants to compute by hand with a phone
sitting bricked.

`tools/carve-partitions.py` closes it. It parses the GPT inside each whole-LUN dump and
writes the same `part-<name>.img` files the per-partition dumps produced, so **every**
partition now has one obvious restore path:

```sh
python3 tools/carve-partitions.py --images ~/backup/gauguin/images
```

It re-derives the sector size rather than assuming it, and validates the guess against the
GPT header's own `MyLBA` field — necessary because a 4096-byte-sector LUN has a valid header
at byte 4096, which is also LBA 8 of a 512-byte-sector disk, and only one of those readings
checks out.

74 partitions are carved in total — the 62 in `sde` plus the 5 in `sdf`, plus
the 7 across `sdb`/`sdc`/`sdd`. All with their signatures verified where a
signature is known:

| | |
|---|---|
| `boot` | 128 MB, `ANDROID!` — the stock boot image |
| `abl`, `ablbak` | XBL itself (ELF32 ARM) |
| `xbl`, `xblbak`, `xbl_config`, `xbl_configbak` | bootloader and its config |
| `tz`, `tzbak` | TrustZone |
| `vbmeta`, `vbmeta_system`, `vbmeta_product`, `vbmeta_vendor`, `vbmeta_odm` | all five AVB tables |
| `modem`, `dsp`, `bluetooth`, `aop`, `hyp`, `cmnlib*`, `keymaster*`, `uefisecapp*` | the rest of the firmware |

`abl` is the one that matters most: it is the thing that runs `fastboot` and decides
whether the phone boots at all. Before this it was reachable only through the whole-LUN
image.

Two of the entries in the signature table were wrong when it was first written, and the
carve is what caught them:

- `dtbo` was checked for the bare DTB magic `\xd0\x0d\xfe\xed`. An Android **DTBO
  image** is not a bare DTB: it has its own 32-byte header, magic `\xd7\xb7\xab\x1e`,
  and the DTBs it carries start at offset 0x280. The real magic is now checked.
- `logo` was checked for PNG magic. On this device it is zeros. The entry is gone
  rather than left to fail — a signature that can never match trains you to ignore
  the warning.

Also, `vbmeta_product`, `vbmeta_vendor` and `vbmeta_odm` are **all zeros** — they are
allocated partitions with nothing in them. Only `vbmeta` and `vbmeta_system` are real
AVB images, which fits the picture in `docs/07`: this ROM's build fingerprint is
`userdebug/test-keys` and `vbmeta` sets `VERIFICATION_DISABLED`.

### Note on `sde`'s partition count

The GPT inside `LUN-sde.img` lists **62** entries, but `docs/04`'s table of the same LUN has
fewer, and the earlier `uefiplat.cfg` work assumed the size. The carve is authoritative — it
reads the table rather than transcribing it. The count differs from what an earlier note in
this project recorded, which is worth knowing before trusting any hand-written table here.

## Before P4: save the user's data

`userdata` holds everything stored on the phone. Installing Windows means repartitioning
that space. Copy anything that matters off the device first — this backup does not
include it, and no public image of the installed ROM exists to fall back on.
