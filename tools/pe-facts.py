"""Per-driver PE facts, and which of them separate the loads that succeeded from
the ones that did not.

The measurement to explain: the panel's `P2 SEQ` line reports 46 promoted
drivers as 19 `s` and 27 `L`, and the failures are not contiguous in any
physical or size ordering. The first hypothesis anyone reaches for is "some
property of the images", so this prints every header field for all 80 DRIVER
files and then, for each field, reports whether its value **separates** the two
sets - i.e. whether some value is taken only by `s` or only by `L`.

Measured on the payload of record: **no field separates them** - and the output
prints the two questions that fact is made of, because they are easy to
conflate.  The equality-class test ("does some value appear only under one
result?") comes out `disjoint` for the size fields and means nothing: every
driver has its own `SizeOfImage`, so of course no two share one.  What would be
a mechanism is a *threshold*, and the threshold column says `interleaved` for
every size field - `s` and `L` values overlap in range.  Everything else is
`shared`: all 80 files have ImageBase 0x0, `IMAGE_FILE_RELOCS_STRIPPED`
(Characteristics bit 0) is clear on all 80, and `SectionAlignment` is 0x1000
except for the Runtime family at 0x10000, which straddles the boundary in both
directions.  Concretely: `WatchdogTimer` fails at 20,580 B while `NpaDxe`
succeeds at 81,966 B, and `PdcDxe` and `ShmBridgeDxe` make the identical
36,864-byte request with opposite results.  `SectionAlignment` is not a PE fact
either - it is the module type, because `SiliciumPkg.dsc.inc` links
`DXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER` with `/ALIGN:0x10000` and everything else with
`/ALIGN:0x1000` - and the eight drivers in that family come out `sssLLLLL`, so it
straddles too, with a 64 KiB size penalty (`ImageSize + SectionAlignment` in
`CoreLoadPeImage`) that totals 0.4 MiB across the set.

The one field that used to be reported here as a partial mechanism - the absence
of `.reloc` from three of the 27 - is **not** one, and the reason is worth keeping
because the mistake is easy to repeat.  "Relocations stripped" is not
`reloc_size == 0`: `PeCoffLoaderGetImageInfo` (`BasePeCoff.c:660`) sets
`ImageContext->RelocationsStripped` from `IMAGE_FILE_RELOCS_STRIPPED`, which is
`Characteristics` bit 0, and that bit is clear on all 80 DRIVER files in this
volume.  So every promoted image takes the `AllocateAnyPages` fallback and none
of them reaches the page-0 `AllocateAddress` path.  `has_reloc` is a fact about
the file; `reloc_stripped` is what the loader does, and only the second is on the
load path.  Both columns are printed, from their own sources, so the two cannot be
conflated again.

The one failure inside `CoreLoadPeImage` that is neither memory nor the image's own
headers is the relocation *type*, and it is now measured here rather than argued.
`PeCoffLoaderRelocateImage` switches on the top four bits of each relocation word
and handles five codes; **everything else falls to `default:`, which calls
`PeCoffLoaderRelocateImageEx`** - and on AArch64 that function is a stub whose body
is `return RETURN_UNSUPPORTED;` (`BasePeCoffLib/PeCoffLoaderEx.c`, bound for
`Sources.AARCH64` in that library's `.inf`).  A single unhandled relocation would
therefore fail the whole load with `EFI_UNSUPPORTED` before `CoreAllocatePages` is
reached, which is why no memory instrument in this project can see it.  Measured
over every DRIVER entry of `work/out/p2-variants/Mu-gauguin-silicon-gzip.img`: the
type set is `{0, 10}` - `ABSOLUTE` and `DIR64`, two of the five handled - and the
unhandled set is **empty on both sides of the `s`/`L` split**.  `RELOC_HANDLED`
names the five and `reloc_types`/`reloc_unhandled` carry the measurement.

An earlier revision of this walk reported `{0, 1, 3, 10}`.  That reading took its
offset from the section order instead of resolving the directory RVA through the
section table, so it decoded words that were not relocation entries: `ABSOLUTE`
entries are padding the loader skips, and the `1`/`3` values were not there.  The
walk now requires a non-zero directory size, resolves the RVA inside a section, and
steps each block by its own `SizeOfBlock`, abandoning it if that field would run
past the directory.  Both readings leave the unhandled set empty - the exoneration
does not turn on which is right - but the narrower one is what the loader sees.

What is left, and what the tail of the output now measures, is the allocator
side. **Ten** of the 46 promoted drivers are runtime drivers, and this tool said
"every one" until that was checked against its own `subsys` column: the
memory type a load requests is the image's *subsystem*, not the allocation
strategy the fallback picks. That type is the one real consequence of the
subsystem column: it decides which bin a request prefers, and the runtime family
oversubscribes its 150-page code bin 5.8x over. It decides nothing else - see the
`RUNTIME_PAGE_ALLOCATION_GRANULARITY` note below, which this tool modelled wrongly
for one revision. The cumulative column is what it always was for: it is what
rules out a running-total boundary. `NpaDxe` is the last success, at 566 pages of
demand, and `ShmBridgeDxe` succeeds again at 647 - with
the *identical* request that `PdcDxe` failed at 591, 36,864 B and 9 pages and the
same subsystem 11. Identical request, opposite result, 56 pages apart.

Two different sets are easy to conflate here and this paragraph did conflate them
once, so both are named: **eight** of the 80 DRIVER files carry
`SectionAlignment` 0x10000 (the set the line above calls `sssLLLLL`), while
**ten** of the 46 promoted are subsystem 12. `EnvDxe` and `SdccDxe` are in the
second set and not the first - subsystem 12 with 0x1000 alignment - and they are
the proof that the two partitions are independent: the subsystem decides the
memory *type*, the link flags decide the `SectionAlignment`, and neither implies
the other. The tail follows the *subsystem*, because the type is what the bin
arithmetic keys off.

**`RUNTIME_PAGE_ALLOCATION_GRANULARITY` is 0x1000 on this platform, so nothing is
rounded and nothing is forced to 64 KiB.** `CoreInternalAllocatePages` does select
that macro for the runtime family (`Page.c:1192-1198`) and does round by it
(`Page.c:1217-1218`), but on AArch64 the macro is a compile-time choice between two
branches and this build takes the 0x1000 one:
`Silicon/Silicium/SiliciumPkg/SiliciumPkg.dsc.inc:14` defines
`__DEPRECATED_AARCH64_4K_RUNTIME_GRANULARITY` for AARCH64, so
`MdePkg/Include/AArch64/ProcessorBind.h:166-167` compiles and `:169` does not. The
rounding is `+= 0` / `&= ~0`; `EFI_SIZE_TO_PAGES (Alignment)` is 1; `Page.c:1207`'s
`NeedGuard = FALSE` guard never fires. This tool carried an `r16` column that
applied a 16-page rounding to subsystem 12 until that was read back against the
source - the column is gone, and with it the "+7 pages" it contributed. **Step
4.156 re-derived the granularity from a search that listed every extension but
`*.dsc.inc`, concluded the macro was undefined, and ordered the 16-page column
put back here and in `tools/load-failure-census.py`; step 4.157 withdrew that
order** from `Silicon/Silicium/SiliciumPkg/SiliciumPkg.dsc.inc:14` (reached
through `gauguin.dsc:71 -> BitraPkg.dsc.inc:20 -> QcomPkg.dsc.inc:10`) and from
the compiled `CC_FLAGS` in
`Build/gauguinPkg/DEBUG_CLANGPDB/AARCH64/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/DxeMain/GNUmakefile:131`.
The `req`/`pg` expression below is the loader's own `Image.c:682-688` and is to
be left as it is. The
`SectionAlignment` effect that *does* exist is separate, is on the image side
(`Image.c:686-690`, `req = SizeOfImage + SectionAlignment`), and is inside the
1562-page total below.

The bin a runtime request prefers is 150 pages of `RuntimeServicesCode` against
873 pages of runtime image demand, of which the four promoted before the failures
begin (`EnvDxe`, `ReportStatusCodeRouterRuntimeDxe`,
`StatusCodeHandlerRuntimeDxe`, `RuntimeDxe`) take 335 - so it is exhausted within
the first four promotions and the fallthrough to the default bin is load-bearing
rather than hypothetical. The default bin spans the heap below the 450-page bin
block, i.e. most of 35.4 MiB. The 873 and the 335 are both exact against the
expression above (15 + 112 + 96 + 112) and are independently `Page.c`'s own
numbers in its `P2BRINGUP` comment, which reads "335 pages between them - 15, 112,
96 and 112"; the prose here said 336 until step 4.157 checked it against its own
arithmetic.

That paragraph is about the *runtime* ten, and it is the whole reason this tool
prints the subsystem column. The 36 boot-service images are not in any bin:
`PrePiHobLib/Hob.c:891-905` is the only writer of the memory type HOB and it
emits five entries, none of them boot-services, so `PcdMemoryTypeEfiBootServicesCode|1000`
and `PcdMemoryTypeEfiBootServicesData|800` in `SiliciumPkg.dsc.inc` are read by
nothing. `InitializeBinStatisticsFromRange` (`MemoryBin.c:281-319`) then clamps
every type without a bin - boot services included - to `*DefaultMaximumAddress`,
so its rung 1 collapses into rung 2 and its rung 3, which is `AllocateAnyPages`
over the whole address space, is not gated by a bin at all. A boot-service
request therefore cannot be refused by a bin boundary; if one is refused, the
whole memory map had no run of that size, which is a stronger and stranger claim
than the one this docstring made before.

The PE is located through the FFS file's EFI_SECTION_PE32 (type 0x10) and then
through `e_lfanew` at 0x3C. Scanning the file body for the literal `PE\\0\\0`
finds the first occurrence anywhere in it, which is how a reader can report a
header for a driver that has none.

    # for this *build*. The memory type passed to CoreAllocatePages is
    # `Image->ImageContext.ImageCodeMemoryType`, which `CoreLoadImageCommon` sets from
    # the PE's **subsystem** (`Image.c:630-645`) - `EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_RUNTIME_DRIVER`
    # (12) -> `EfiRuntimeServicesCode`, 11 -> `EfiBootServicesCode`, 10 ->
    # `EfiLoaderCode` - and it is not the `!RelocationsStripped` fallback, which only
    # chooses between AllocateAddress and AllocateAnyPages at `Image.c:713/733` and
    # passes the same `ImageCodeMemoryType` to both. `CoreInternalAllocatePages` does
    # then select `Alignment = RUNTIME_PAGE_ALLOCATION_GRANULARITY` for the runtime
    # family (`Page.c:1192-1198`) and does round `NumberOfPages` by it at

    #   1. MemoryMapLib.h's SYS_MEM_CAP is PRESENT|INITIALIZED|TESTED plus the
    #      cacheability bits and the three *_PROTECTABLE bits. Every one of those
    #      outside the first three is also outside Gcd.c's MEMORY_ATTRIBUTE_MASK,
    #      so `attr & MASK` is exactly TESTED_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES (0x7) and the
    #      region is EfiGcdMemoryTypeSystemMemory, not Reserved. The mask holds
    #      *_PROTECTED (EXECUTION_PROTECTED 0x200), not *_PROTECTABLE
    #      (EXECUTION_PROTECTABLE 0x400000); reading one for the other makes this
    #      look like a Reserved region and the comparison below look invalid.
    #
    #   2. MemoryInitPei.c builds a memory allocation HOB for each such region,
    #      and CoreInitializeGcdServices hands that HOB's own MemoryType to
    #      CoreAddMemoryDescriptor (Gcd.c:2776). For the Conv column that is
    #      EfiConventionalMemory.
    #
    # The other three rows carrying Conv are MMAP_IO rather than SYS_MEM, so they
    # are EfiGcdMemoryTypeMemoryMappedIo and never reach that call: the DXE Heap
    # is the only row that is both SYS_MEM/SYS_MEM_CAP and Conv.

    #     as both the memory range and the PHIT's free range, so EfiMemoryTop and
    #     EfiFreeMemoryTop both start at 0x9DB60000 and EfiMemoryBottom at
    #     0x9B800000.
    #   * PrePi then allocates downward from EfiFreeMemoryTop
    #     (PrePiMemoryAllocationLib.c:30-54), and the biggest thing it takes is the
    #     decompressed FVMAIN, which is exactly FVMAIN.Fv on disk.
