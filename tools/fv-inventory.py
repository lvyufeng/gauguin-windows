"""List what is actually inside the firmware volume of a built `Mu-<device>.img`.

This exists because the obvious check is misleading. The `.img` is an Android
boot image whose kernel payload is `gzip(BootShim.bin + SILICIUM_UEFI.fd)`, and
`SILICIUM_UEFI.fd` is **not** the firmware volume — it is `FVMAIN_COMPACT`, a
0x300000-byte volume whose only real content is `FVMAIN`, a ~7 MB volume, held
inside a single compressed GUIDed section.

So every driver name and every driver GUID is inside a compressed stream. A
walk of the outer volume reports two files and none of the drivers, which
looks exactly like a firmware that shipped empty, and is not.

    python3 tools/fv-inventory.py Mu-gauguin.img            # list everything
    python3 tools/fv-inventory.py Mu-gauguin.img --usb      # just the USB stack
    python3 tools/fv-inventory.py --verify uefi/Binaries/gauguin ...
    python3 tools/fv-inventory.py Mu-gauguin.img --against Build/.../FVMAIN.Fv.txt
    python3 tools/fv-inventory.py Mu-gauguin.img --dump-fvmain /tmp/FVMAIN.Fv

`--verify DIR` compares the driver .inf FILE_GUIDs under DIR against the ones
really present, which is the check that answers "is the driver I packaged
actually in the image" - and it is answered by GUID, not by name, because the
names are inside compressed sections and searching the raw bytes for them
silently finds nothing.

`--against MAP` compares the walk against GenFv's own `FVMAIN.Fv.txt`, which is
the half of the check this tool cannot make about itself: it is an independent
record of what the build put where, so it catches a reader that is wrong in a way
that still looks plausible. It exits nonzero on any mismatch, and mismatching a
map from a different platform is the test that it can fail at all.

    The file area does not always begin at `HeaderLength`. When the volume has
    an extension header (ExtHeaderOffset != 0, which GenFv emits on the volumes
    it wraps around a compressed image), the files begin after it — and the
    end of the extension header is only 4-byte aligned, while FFS files must
    be 8-byte aligned, so GenFv pads to the next 8.

    Both details matter and both fail silently in the same way: start four
    bytes early and the first GUID reads as `ffffffffe70e51fcdcffd411bd410080`,
    which is not a GUID, so the walk returns nothing and the volume looks
    empty. That is a bug in the reader, not a hole in the firmware.

    For FVMAIN of the gauguin build the answer is `0x78`, but *not* for the
    reason this function's earlier comment gave. It read a UINT32 at `ext_off
    + 16` and called it `ExtHeaderSize`, 0x14; the extension header's real
    size is the UINT16 at `ext_off + 0`, which reads 0x4C84 here, and a start
    derived from that is `0x4CE4` — from which the walk collects four files and
    then hits an impossible size field at 0xD550. So the candidates are not
    both plausible: only `0x78` partitions the volume into a contiguous chain
    that ends exactly on the all-0xFF terminator at 0x730960, **126 files**,
    and the build's own `FVMAIN.Fv.txt` lists those same 126 GUIDs in that same
    order. The 0x14 read is load-bearing and its interpretation is not; a
    candidate that walks to the terminator is the evidence, and Step 4.253
    measured that no frame rule can substitute for it (the map's offset minus
    the file's offset is 0x200 for 114 lines, 0x4D8 for 10 and 0 for 2, so
    "map minus 504" is a shift fitted to the lines it already worked for and
    it excluded the volume's first two files on that basis).
