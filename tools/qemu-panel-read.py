"""Read the bring-up console off a firmware running under QEMU, by sampling its own memory.

The panel is the only channel this firmware has. `SerialPortLib` is bound to
`FrameBufferSerialPortLib` in a DEBUG build, so every `DEBUG ((...))` in the tree
comes out as pixels in the "Display Reserved" region and nowhere else, and every
reading this phase has produced has been a person looking at a screen and typing
back what they saw - which is why `panel-text.py` exists and why its history is a
list of mis-transcriptions.

The screen is not the only thing that holds those pixels. Under QEMU the firmware
runs in a process that can dump its own memory, so the same console can be read
without a photograph, without a phone, and without a transcription: dump the region
`GetFrameBufferMemory` prints into and hand it to `panel-text.py --fb`, which
decodes it exactly - the values are only 0 and 1 and the origin is known, so there
is nothing to estimate.

What this tool adds is the part the console makes hard: **a dump is one screen and
not the log.** When the cursor passes the last row, `AdvanceNewLine` zeroes the
whole buffer rather than scrolling, so a log longer than the panel is read as the
last 100 printed rows and never the first. Every run of this payload so far has
been the other case - 92 rows of log onto a 100-row screen, so the screen holds the
whole log from its first row and each sample is the previous one extended, which is
what lets the record read as one continuous stream. Either way the region is
sampled repeatedly and the screens are joined on content (`panel-text.py`'s
`fb_overlap`), which recovers the stream as long as consecutive samples share a
line. At `PcdFrameBufferDelay` 10000 us per newline a full screen takes about a
second, so the default quarter-second interval has room to spare.

A sample that joins onto nothing is reported and not spliced over, and the report
says which of two things it was, because they are not the same finding: a row the
console rewrote in place (a line printed without a newline, so the next print
continues on its row) shows up as a screen the stream already holds most of, and
appending it duplicates the log while losing nothing; a screen of rows the stream
does not hold is text printed between two samples, and that is a hole.

The region's address and length are read out of the platform's `MemoryMapLib.c` and
not passed in, for the same reason `panel-text.py` reads the font out of `Font.h`:
a remembered 0xA0000000 is a guess that stops being true silently.

    # launch the payload and sample it for a minute
    tools/qemu-panel-read.py --kernel /tmp/gauguin-kernel.raw --seconds 60

The output file carries the run's provenance - payload hash, the command line, the
region, the sample count, the gaps - because a boot log with no record of what was
booted is a paragraph someone typed.

    Every address the stub has to agree with is a `--defsym` and not a `.set` in
    the source: the payload's, because the stub's `eret` has to land on the same
    byte the `-device loader` line puts there; its own, because a stage-2 table
    entry is an absolute physical address and the stub is raw bytes at an address
    rather than a linked image; and the address whose stage-2 block is redirected,
    because the same number has to be read back out of the guest afterwards. A
    number written in two files is a number that can differ. The source's own
    header has the argument for existing at all.

    `zero_mem` adds the stage-2 half, which is assembled in or out rather than
    branched over, so a capture with it off is the same capture as before it
    existed. With it on, `plan` is the redirect table `l2_plan` worked out and it
    is written out as `s2_l2.inc` for the source to `.include`: the assembler has
    no way to read a memory map, and a table transcribed into the source by hand
    would be a second description of this machine that could drift from the one
    the firmware was built with.

    The object is *linked* and only then turned into raw bytes, and that is not
    decoration. A PC-relative reference to a global symbol is not something the
    assembler may resolve - the linker could still move it - so `as` emits a
    relocation and leaves the field zero. `objcopy -O binary` on the unlinked
    object therefore produces a stub whose `adr x2, s2_l1` loads the address of
    the `adr` itself: the stage-2 half was inert for two runs, with VTTBR_EL2
    pointing at the stub's own instructions, and the symptom was a boot that
    looked like a stage-2 permission fault. Linking the object is what makes the
    addresses in the binary the addresses the assembly names. Local symbols were
    resolved all along, which is why only the stage-2 half was affected and the
    plain EL3 stub worked.

    `seed` is `(pool block, base, size)` - the address `l2_plan` gave the block
    holding `ZERO_MEM_IPA`, and this board's SMEM region - and passing it is what
    turns SEED_SMEM on. The stub does the rest of the arithmetic: it adds the
    IPA's own offset within its 2 MB and SEED_SMEM_OFF to reach the two places it
    writes, so the offset is written in one file, and the read-back below checks
    the result rather than assuming it. A seed and a redirect are one feature: the
    pool block the seed lands in is reached by the guest only because the redirect
    exists, and a seed with no redirect would be bytes nothing reads.

    The symbol table the launcher reads offsets from stays the object's - a linked
    ELF's symbols are absolute and `stub_symbol`'s offsets would stop being
    offsets - so only the binary comes from the linked image.

    `aop` is `(pool block, ipa, state, magic)` - where the block holding
    `AOP_SS_MSG_RAM` was put, the address `CmdDbDxe` reads, and the two values its
    entry gate compares the pointer's target against - and passing it turns
    SEED_AOP on. It is a second seed and deliberately not folded into the first:
    the two answer different drivers, the first is what gets the boot past Apriori
    slot 2 at all, and a rung that turns both on at once cannot say which of the
    two moved the log. The stub's own header has the argument for why the word is
    a pointer.

    failed: the pool address of the page holding the SMEM word, the pointer value
    as the guest will dereference it, the pool address of the structure, the first
    qword as the stub recorded having written it, the structure's three words as
    the machine holds them, the word the stub put at `flag_addr` - which is inside
    SMEM itself and not inside anything this file laid out - the two addresses in
    SMEM that only the stub knows along with what the machine holds at each, and
    the pool address of the AOP mailbox word (zero when that seed is off) along
    with the three words at it.

    The check that matters is not that these equal what the launcher asked for -
    the launcher asked for two addresses and never named the structure - but that
    they are *internally* consistent, which is a claim about the guest's walk and
    not about this file's intent. `pointer - struct_pool` is the IPA offset the
    pointer names minus the pool offset the bytes sit at, and if those are equal
    the byte the guest's stage-2 redirect will fetch is the byte written here.
    The caller does that comparison; this function only fetches.

    The last four fields are the rung above the container, and they are fetched
    the same way and for the same reason: the TOC and the heap table are in SMEM
    rather than in the stub's own 64 KB, so they are read by the address the stub
    recorded instead of by a symbol of this file's, and the AOP pair is in a
    window neither end owns. Every one of them is a read of what the machine
    holds, so a seed that wrote the right number to the wrong place reads back as
    the right number at the wrong place, which is the only way to tell the two
    apart.
