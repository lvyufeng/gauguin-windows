#
# Build one variant payload and prove that what came out is what was asked for.
# Three experiments are defined below: `arch-first` reorders the a-priori batch,
# `xhci-host` adds the USB host stack, and `apriori-extras` promotes four drivers
# into the a-priori batch that this build packages but leaves out of it.
#
# Why arch-first exists. The nine architectural protocols DXE never installs
# (Security, Bds, Watchdog, Variable, Variable Write, Capsule, Monotonic, Reset,
# RTC - docs/08 step 4.95) are all providers that sit late in APRIORI.inc, and the
# batch runs in APRIORI.inc order, not in firmware-volume order. So there are two
# readings of the same evidence and the static pass cannot separate them:
#
#   * these drivers fail wherever they are put, or
#   * something between the providers that do install and these eight fails them.
#
# Running the eight early separates them, and it is the only experiment that does
# so without changing anything else: no driver is added, removed or rebuilt, the
# volume keeps every file at every offset it had, and the only bytes that differ
# between this image and the baseline are the Apriori GUID array. What the panel
# then shows is the answer to both halves at once - whether the eight install,
# and which driver in the block they were moved ahead of is the first to fail
# (`P2 SEQ`, one character per entry, in the order they ran).
#
# Why xhci-host exists. The firmware has no USB host controller driver, so it
# cannot see a USB stick, and a Windows installer has to arrive on one (P3). The
# blob cannot be extracted from this phone - its XBL carries no host driver, only
# the device-mode one - so the three files come from the SM7225 sibling instead
# and the platform gains a build switch, USE_XHCI_HOST_DRIVER, that is off until
# this script turns it on. What is being checked here is that EDK2 accepts the
# three INFs at all: bitra's copies are used verbatim, which means a DXE_DEPEX
# section, a module type per file and QC's own binding, none of which the other
# 55 blobs in this image carry. A payload that builds, packs and passes the
# gates is the whole result - nothing here says the controller comes up on the
# device, and only the panel can say that.
#
# Unlike `arch-first` this one does *not* reorder anything. bitra lists
# XhciPciEmulationDxe and XhciDxe in its own APRIORI.inc as well as its DXE.inc,
# and that half is deliberately not copied: a driver in the a-priori batch is
# promoted by `Dispatcher.c:2111` setting `DriverEntry->Dependent = FALSE`, so
# its depex - here a conjunction of thirteen architectural protocols - is read
# and then ignored, and it would start before the protocols it names exist. See
# XHCI_HOST_DRIVERS in tools/make_uefi_platform.py. The consequence for this
# experiment is a useful one: APRIORI.inc is byte-identical to the default
# generation's, the a-priori array stays at 70 entries, and the P2 instrument
# keeps reading the same shape it reads on the payload now in `boot`.
#
# Usage:  tools/build-apriori-variant.sh [EXPERIMENT]
#
#   arch-first   the eight arch providers run before the Qualcomm block.
#                The default, and the definition of the experiment is the
#                ARCH_FIRST_NAMES list below rather than this script's argument
#                handling.
#   xhci-host    the USB host stack is added, and nothing is reordered. The
#                blobs are staged from Binaries/bitra/ into
#                uefi/Binaries/gauguin/, which is a directory this repository
#                ignores, so the tracked tree only ever differs by the DSC
#                switch - and restore() puts even that back.
#
#   apriori-extras
#                PwrUtilsDxe, VcsDxe, FeatureEnablerDxe and MacDxe join the
#                a-priori batch at their alioth anchors. No file is added or
#                removed and no offset in the volume moves; the only difference
#                from the default payload is the Apriori GUID array. Four rows
#                of EXTRA_DRIVERS in the generator were meant to do this from the
#                start and did nothing at all until step 4.171, which is why this
#                is a switch and not the default: the stock firmware's own array
#                promotes three of the four, and letting a bug fix change the
#                dispatch order of every future build is how the payload in
#                `boot` stops being comparable to the one being flashed.
#
# Environment:
#   DISPLAY=simple|qcom   which display driver the platform is regenerated with.
#                         Default simple, because that is what the baseline
#                         payloads are; changing it here would make this two
#                         variables instead of one.
