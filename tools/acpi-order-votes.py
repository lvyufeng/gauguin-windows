"""Score gauguin's device declaration order against the corpus, and relocate it.

`tools/acpi/gauguin.asl` was not written in one sitting; it was assembled node by
node, each one argued against the reference tables in Silicium-ACPI, and each one
appended where it was easiest to write. Nothing ever compared the *order* of that
assembly to the order the corpus uses — and the corpus does state an order:
twenty-one tables declare `ABD`, and about every pair of gauguin's node names
they can agree on which comes first. Nine of them state `SPMI` after `SCM0`,
twenty of them state `UCS0` last, and so on.

A pair the corpus agrees on is a *relation*, and a relation gauguin's file
reverses is a defect in a file whose method is "the corpus is the specification".
Step 4.84 counted those defects (128 broken relations over seven placements) and
recorded them as a debt; this tool is how the debt is measured and how the order
that pays it is chosen.

The unit of measurement is the **table-vote**. A table that declares both nodes
of a pair votes on that pair's direction; a pair's weight is the number of tables
voting on it. Two framings are printed, because the earlier steps used the first
and the reorder was chosen under the second:

  unanimity   a pair is a relation only if no table contradicts it. The file
              either satisfies such a relation or breaks it, and "broken" is a
              defect that cannot be argued away. This is the 128 of Step 4.84.

  majority    every pair counts. A table that dissents alone does not delete a
              pair from the accounting; it lowers what any order can reach. The
              ceiling is the *pairwise upper bound* - for each pair, the larger
              of its two counts, summed - and an order that attains it cannot be
              improved by any permutation. This framing is what makes an order
              provably optimal rather than merely good, and it is why a lone
              dissenting table shows up as an unavoidable cost instead of as a
              hole in the data.

`--moves` turns a target order into the minimal set of relocations from the
file's order, by longest common subsequence: the nodes not in the LCS are the
ones that move, and each one is re-inserted at the index the target gives it.
`--fixed-point` asks the complementary question of the *result*: take each node
out in turn and re-insert it at every index, and report whether the slot it
occupies is among the ones that maximise the score. An order that is a fixed
point of that operation is one where no single node is misplaced, which is a
different claim from being the global optimum - and where a node has no relation
at all, the two disagree, which is worth seeing rather than hiding.

One of the tables the corpus offers can be *this* table: the corpus is a
Mu-Silicium checkout's `Silicium-ACPI` submodule and the sync script installs
ours into it. A file scoring itself is not a measurement, so that copy is left
out by default; `--keep-self` puts it back, and `corpus_nodes`'s last paragraph
has what the difference was measured to be.

Usage:
    tools/acpi-order-votes.py                        # current order, every subset
    tools/acpi-order-votes.py --subset ABD           # only the 21 ABD tables
    tools/acpi-order-votes.py --order "UFS0 DEV0 ..."
    tools/acpi-order-votes.py --order "$(python3 -c ...)" --moves
    tools/acpi-order-votes.py --fixed-point
    tools/acpi-order-votes.py --prove                # the ceiling and who dissents
    tools/acpi-order-votes.py --asl /tmp/candidate.asl
    tools/acpi-order-votes.py --keep-self            # count our own copy as a voter

The corpus itself is read from the cached disassembly `tools/acpi-hid-census.py`
writes (36 reference trees, ~90 s of `iasl -d`); that tool owns the disassembly
and the table list, and this one imports both rather than repeating them.

    Keyed by the *disassembled* file's name, not the AML's: `disassemble()`
    flattens the path into the cache name (`Platforms-Xiaomi-lisa-DSDT.dsl`),
    and every AML in the tree is called `DSDT.aml` or `SSDT.aml` or one of the
    board variants, so keying by the AML collapses sixty-odd tables into five
    and silently merges their orders. It was measured that way once - the merged
    set reports 465 pairs over 41 tables' worth of nodes with the CPU block
    appearing to break twenty-one relations each - and the merge is what that
    artifact is.

    `drop` is the platform directory name of the file being scored, and a corpus
    table whose flattened path carries it is left out. The corpus is the
    Mu-Silicium checkout's own `Silicium-ACPI` submodule and the sync script
    installs *this* table into it, so without `drop` the file under test is one
    of the tables voting on its own order - and the vote it casts is whichever
    revision of itself that checkout happens to carry. Measured while writing
    Step 4.88: the corpus's cached copy had been built from a 1,520-byte AML,
    4,830 bytes behind the file it was a copy of, because
    `acpi-hid-census.disassemble` keyed its cache on the path and the one table
    in this tree that ever changes is ours. Both halves are fixed - the cache
    now rebuilds a disassembly older than its `.aml`, and this parameter keeps
    the copy out of the count - but the exclusion is by *name*, which is weaker
    than the content identity the rest of this repository insists on, so the
    tool prints both framings (`--keep-self`) instead of one. On 4.88 they agree
    on the verdict - broken 0 and score equal to the ceiling, 9,768/9,768 with
    the copy out and 10,368/10,368 with it in - and differ by the 37 pairs and
    600 votes the copy contributes.

    Those 37 pairs are the pairs **no other table in the corpus declares**, and
    they are worth knowing separately from the framing question: 34 of them are
    `UAR2`'s and three are `I2C8`'s against `I2C9`, `IC11` and `IPCC`. With the
    copy dropped, `UAR2` is left with no pair at all - which is why
    `--fixed-point` finds it tied with every slot - while the other engines keep
    30 to 33. The stale 1,520-byte copy was rebuilt and scored to see what the
    fault cost (`broken 0`, so no verdict changed): its ten nodes declare no QUP
    engine, so it contributes none of these 37 pairs and only adds votes to pairs
    that already existed, moving the score and the ceiling together.
