"""Count what the reference tables do with the USB hub/port pair, reproducibly.

`tools/acpi/gauguin.asl` writes `RHUB` and `PRT1` under both of `URS0`'s
children, and the comment above `USB0`'s copy states the corpus's behaviour as
numbers: how many tables carry the pair, how many carry neither, what the two
bodies contain, what `_UPC` says under each controller, and which slot in the
parent's member list the node occupies. Those numbers were measured with a
throwaway script in `/tmp`, and this repository's own standard - stated in
`acpi-hid-census.disassemble`'s docstring - is that a number a reader cannot
reproduce from the repository is not a measurement. Step 4.91 is what came of
running the same questions again from here: seven of the numbers moved, and one
of those is not an arithmetic slip but a field the earlier reading could not
see at all, which is the argument for having the tool rather than the number.

The unit is the **declaration**, and each is attributed to the device that
encloses it by a single brace-stack pass over the disassembly, so `USB0`'s
`RHUB` and `UFN0`'s `RHUB` are two occurrences with different parents rather
than two matches of one pattern. Counting `grep -c RHUB` over the corpus gives
the same totals here and would give the wrong answer the moment a table nested
one inside something else - which is exactly what `nabu` does.

Two readings of the disassembly are needed and they do not agree: a field can
be named in the text or it can be bytes in a buffer. `PLD_GroupPosition` is
named in a `ToPLD (...)` and is a bit field at a fixed offset in a
`Buffer (0x14)`; iasl renders the second form for a `_PLD` built as a
`VarPackage`, which pipa's four are, so a name-only reading reports four
values absent that the table in fact states - two of them not zero. `_UPC` is
named in every port in this corpus, so its reading is by name alone and its
one `absent` is a port that has no `_UPC`.

Three controller bands are reported rather than two, because the pair is not
only under `URS0` and `URS1`: one occurrence in the corpus sits under a
controller whose name is neither, and a two-band reading has to file it
somewhere wrong. `A` is `USB0`/`UFN0`, `B` is `USB1`/`UFN1`, `X` is anything
else, and `X` is one row here - which is a fact about the corpus, not a
rounding.

One of the tables in the corpus can be *this* table: the corpus is a
Mu-Silicium checkout's `Silicium-ACPI` submodule and
`tools/sync-uefi-platform.sh` installs ours into it, so ours is one of the
sixty-six. A file counting itself is not corroboration, so it is left out by
default - the same rule and the same default as `tools/acpi-order-votes.py` -
and `--keep-self` prints the other framing. Both framings are printed side by
side, because the difference *is* the finding: it is exactly the contribution
of the file being written.

# scope, not a device, and the walk pushes an empty frame for it.
#
# The name of the first five is one to four characters rather than exactly four.
# AML pads a short name with trailing underscores on disk, but `iasl -d` prints
# what was written, and the corpus holds 196 three-character `Device`s (`ABD`,
# `CDI`, `GPS`, `GSI`, `IPA`, `LLC`, `MPA`, `QSM`, `RP1`, `SSM`, ...), 150
# three-character `ThermalZone`s, 79 short `Method`s and 56 short `Name`s, 19 of
# them two characters. A `{4}` read every one of them as no declaration at all,
# so their bodies were billed to whatever enclosed them and a question asked
# about one of those names - `--empty ABD`, say - came back with zero nodes and
# no complaint. The guard in `walk` stops a match starting inside a longer
# identifier, and AML has no five-character name, so the widening adds the short
# names and nothing else.
#
# `Scope` and `External` keep the four-character floor, because their argument
# is the one that is not a name - it is a namespace *path*, and every table but
# ours prints it with its root or parent marker: `Scope (\_SB.PEP0)`, `Scope
# (^^GIO0)`. `Scope (_SB)`, bare, is printed in twelve tables, this one among
# them, and it is `\_SB` with the marker dropped. Read at three characters it
# becomes a frame named `_SB` and re-parents every device in those twelve
# tables, which is not an improvement in attribution but a regression in it, and
# it moves the ADC census's "is the block the last device of the table" reading
# for this table and no other. Four characters is what keeps a root reference
# out of a chain the walk documents as holding device names.
