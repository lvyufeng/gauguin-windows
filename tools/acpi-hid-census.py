"""Can gauguin's ACPI device names be taken from another Qualcomm DSDT?

`tools/acpi/gauguin.asl` began as exactly five things: UFS, the USB controller
and its two children, and the eight CPUs. P3 item 1 asks for I2C, SPI, GPIO,
buttons and thermal zones on top of that, and none of those nodes was in the
file. The device tree supplies every one of their *addressing* facts - register
windows, interrupt numbers, pin numbers - so the obvious next move is to lift
the nodes out of a platform that already has them and substitute the addresses.
(GPIO and the PMIC family have since gone in that way; this docstring describes
the question the tool was written to answer, and its answer is why they could.)

That move is only sound if the names travel. A Qualcomm DSDT block carries a
`_HID` like `QCOM1A0C`, an `_AEI` template, a `_REG` hook and a `_DSM` whose
UUID and return value are not documented anywhere in this tree. If `QCOM1A0C`
means "the TLMM block, wherever it is", it can be copied with the window
changed. If it means "this SoC's GPIO controller", copying it produces a device
node that no driver binds to - and Windows reports nothing when a device node
has an unknown `_HID`. It is simply absent from Device Manager. A silently
unbound node is worse than no node, because no node is visibly missing.

So this measures the question rather than arguing it. It disassembles every
reference DSDT in the Silicium-ACPI tree, joins each device to the block it
describes by the `Memory32Fixed` base address - the one key both the ACPI and
the device-tree worlds carry - and tabulates the `_HID` seen at each of
gauguin's own block addresses.

    python3 tools/acpi-hid-census.py                   # the address join
    python3 tools/acpi-hid-census.py --functions       # the name join
    python3 tools/acpi-hid-census.py --blocks          # gauguin's block list
    python3 tools/acpi-hid-census.py --drivers DIR     # which INFs bind these

Measured 2026-09-25, **65** reference tables - the 66th file under this tree is
`Platforms/Xiaomi/gauguin/DSDT.aml`, which this build generates from
`tools/acpi/gauguin.asl`, and `table_files` excludes it: a corpus that counts the
table being written scores our own choices back to us, and the numerators below
were always measured against the 65. Three defects were found and fixed in
the drafts of this file, and all three made a negative answer look stronger
than the corpus supports:

    TLMM    0x0F100000   11 tables have a device here, 5 distinct _HIDs
                         QCOM1A0C x4   OnePlus/lemonade, Xiaomi/venus,
                                       Xiaomi/vili, Qualcomm/Lahaina/DSDT_MTP
                         QCOM0A0C x2   Samsung/a52sxq, Xiaomi/lisa
                         QCOM090C x2   Xiaomi/renoir, Qualcomm/Cedros/DSDT_IDP
                         QCOM0C0C x2   Qualcomm/Kailua/DSDT_MTP, .../DSDT_QRD
                         QCOM250C x1   Xiaomi/alioth
    SPMI    0x0C440000   no device *at this address*; 22 tables declare a
                         window at 0x0C400000 that contains it
    TSENS0  0x0C263000   no device at this address, no thermal node anywhere
    TSENS1  0x0C265000   same
    SE0..SE7 0x00[89]xxxxx  every window carries a different name per SoC

The 36 came from reading each platform's `DSDT.aml`, which is the trim. The
board variants are where Qualcomm writes the *complete* device list: Lahaina
ships `DSDT_MTP` (152 `Device` nodes) and `DSDT_Minimal` (8) and no plain
`DSDT.aml` at all, so the trim-only glob read none of Lahaina's device list in
any form - and Lahaina is the platform whose `GIO0` sits on gauguin's exact
TLMM window and length. Three of the four new TLMM references are variants.
Counted by name rather than by address, `GIO0` appears in 21 of the 65 tables
and `SPMI` in 22.

The second error is the join key, and the way it failed is worth copying down
because it is not the obvious one. **An address is a weak key, because a
reference's `_CRS` is often much coarser than the block it declares.** The
corpus's `SPMI` node claims `0x0C400000` for `0x02800000` - forty megabytes -
and gauguin's arbiter at `0x0C440000` sits inside that region. So an equality
test says "no device here" about a block that 22 of these 65 tables describe,
and it does so with the same confidence whether the corpus is empty or full.
Containment, not equality, is the test that matches how `_CRS` is written; what
carries across SoCs even better is the device *name* - every reference table
calls the GPIO controller `GIO0` and the arbiter `SPMI` regardless of where
their windows are. `--functions` joins on that.

Measured 2026-09-25, the name join:

    GIO0   02->17  05->0D  08->0D  09->0C  0A->0C  0C->0C  14->0D  1A->0C  25->0C  60->16
    SPMI   02->16  05->0C  08->0C  09->0B  0A->0B  0C->0B  14->0C  1A->0B  25->0B
    MMU0   02->12  05->09  08->09  09->09  0A->09  0C->09  14->09  1A->09  25->09
    QDSS   02->8C  05->5A  08->5A  09->56  0A->56  0C->56  14->5A  1A->56  25->56
    RFS0   02->35  05->17  08->17  09->15  0A->15  0C->15  14->17  1A->15  25->15

So a Qualcomm `_HID` is `QCOM` + two hex pairs, and the pairs are not
independent. The low pair is a block index that a whole *generation* of the
table generator shares: the families {09, 0A, 0C, 1A, 25} put the arbiter at 0B,
the GPIO controller at 0C, the MMU at 09, QDSS at 56 and RFS at 15, while the
older group {05, 08, 14} uses 0C, 0D, 09, 5A and 17 for the same five devices.
SDM850's 02 is a third group of its own - 16, 17, 12, 8C, 35 - which is why this
list used to be wrong: treating {02, 05, 08, 14} as one generation put the
arbiter at the wrong index for one of its four families. `MMU0` is the exception
that shows the axis is the generator and not the silicon: it stayed at 09 across
05 08 09 0A 0C 14 1A 25 and moved only for 02.

The high pair is a chipset-family token, and it does not follow the SoC's
marketing number: pipa and alioth both declare `SDM8250` and carry 05 and 25
respectively. Across the eleven tables where a GIO0 and an OEM table id can both
be read, the pairs are SDM850 02, SDM8150 05, SDM8250 05, SDM8250 25, SDM7180 08,
SDM7350 09, SDM7280 0A, SDM8550 0C, SDM7150 14, SDM8350 1A, SDM636 60.

**What that leaves is one byte, not a name.** The node shapes are all here -
`GIO0` with its `_CRS`, its interrupts and its pin tables; `SPMI`; `I2C<n>`,
`SPI<n>` and `UR<n>` for the GENI SE blocks, named by protocol; `BTNS` as a
standard `ACPI0011` Generic Buttons Device with Microsoft's `_DSD` UUID, whose
own `_HID` needs no vendor INF - though its `_CRS` names `\\_SB.PM01` as the
controller its `GpioInt` resources belong to, so it cannot be added on its own
either: a PMIC node has to exist for it, and a PMIC node carries this same
family byte. What cannot be read off the corpus is which family
SM7225 carries, and therefore whether its GPIO controller is `QCOM??0C` or
`QCOM??0D` - let alone what `??` is. But the search for it is finite and
mechanical: ten of gauguin's twelve blocks have a known index in each of the
measured generations, so a driver set either answers to `QCOM<byte><index>` for
all ten or it does not. No SM7225 table exists here: the only one that declares
the name is `Platforms/Xiaomi/gauguin/DSDT.aml`, and that is the file this tree
generated. Searching the corpus for `SM7225` returns our own work.

**And the reason is structural, not an accident of this corpus.** ACPI's `_HID`
is not a hardware fact; it is a string this port gets to choose, and the only
thing that constrains the choice is that a driver has to claim it. That the same
block appears under five different names in five reference DSDTs is evidence
about the choice being free, not about a name being lost.

So the direction of the work is unchanged but much narrower than "the tables
cannot be written": **adopt a driver set first, then name every block after it.**
The DSDT is written *to a driver*, not *to the SoC*, and an `.inf` lists exactly
the ids its driver answers to - so the driver set is not a later step, it is
where the missing two digits come from. A node described with an `_HID` no
available driver claims is hardware that cannot be driven, and it fails
silently: no error, no warning, just a device absent from Device Manager.

`--drivers DIR` takes a set and reports which of gauguin's blocks it covers,
which is the check to run the moment one is in hand, and it also answers the
question in the other direction - whose driver set this is, read off which names
it answers to. The same mechanism is what P5 means by "re-bind the WoA driver
INF" for the GPU.

Every `yes` row names the `.inf` that declares the id, which is not decoration.
A covered block and a *collision* look identical in a `yes`, and the difference
is only visible in the file: measured 2026-09-27, the SC7280/Kodiak set answers
`yes` to `SE1`, `SE2`, `SE3`, `SE5` and `SE7` on `QCOM0A10`, and `QCOM0A10` is
`qci2c7280.inf` - the **I2C** controller. Those five rows were coverage of the
I2C engines, which gauguin already has, being read as coverage of SPI engines it
does not. The set's `0F` is the same story in the other direction: `QCOM0A0F` is
in it, and the file that declares it is `qcslimbus7280.inf`.

Three ways this file fooled itself, recorded because all three agreed with the
conclusion being reached at the time. The `isinstance(True, int)` sentinel in
`devices_in`, which reported that *no* reference describes *any* of gauguin's
blocks; reading `*/DSDT.aml` alone, which reported that two of them have no
reference *at all*; and an equality test on the address, where containment is
what a `_CRS` actually means. Each one produced the same answer - nothing here
describes this - with perfect confidence and for a reason unconnected to the
corpus. A negative result is easiest to believe when it matches what you were
about to say, and the third one is the hardest to notice, because a miss read as
an absence looks exactly like a miss.

    """Every ACPI table in the reference tree, not just each platform's DSDT.

    The first draft of this tool read `*/DSDT.aml` alone and concluded that two
    of gauguin's blocks had no reference anywhere. That was wrong, and wrong in
    the direction that flatters a negative result: the tree also carries the
    board variants (`DSDT_MTP`, `DSDT_QRD`, `DSDT_IDP`) and the SSDTs, and the
    variants are where Qualcomm writes the *complete* device list. Lahaina's
    `DSDT.aml` has 24 devices; Lahaina's `DSDT_MTP` has 152, including the
    `GIO0` node on gauguin's exact TLMM window.

    **The one file this excludes is the one being written.** `Platforms/Xiaomi/
    gauguin/DSDT.aml` is generated from `tools/acpi/gauguin.asl` by this tree's
    own build, so counting it makes every question here self-referential in the
    direction that flatters the answer: a block we have already described gains
    a reference, and a name we chose comes back as a name the corpus agrees on.
    It is not hypothetical. The corpus is 66 files of which one is ours, and six
    of our forty-odd nodes were being read back as evidence - `GIO0`, `SPMI`,
    `UAR2`, `I2C8`, `I2C9` and `IC11` - which inflated TLMM from 11 references
    to 12, SE3 from 3 to 4, SE7 from 3 to 4, and gave SE0u and SE5 a third
    "distinct name" apiece that exists in no other table. Measured 2026-09-27.

    Because the effect grows with our own work - every node added to
    `gauguin.asl` adds a reference to its own block - this filter is what makes
    two runs of this tool comparable across time. Step 4.58's counts were taken
    before `UAR2` existed and today's unfiltered run reads one higher for a
    reason that has nothing to do with the corpus. The same class of mistake is
    why `acpi-dep-census.py` was rewritten at Step 4.94 and why the cache key
    below is the tree and not the path.

    `keep_self=True` returns the raw glob, and exists because four tools in
    `tools/` load this module to get the corpus and then do their *own*
    dropping, each with its own `--keep-self`: `acpi-dep-census.py`,
    `acpi-order-votes.py`, `acpi-adc-blob-census.py` and
    `acpi-usb-pair-census.py`. Their drop is by the stem of the `--asl` they
    are handed, which is a different rule from this one and is the rule their
    prose is written against. Excluding the file here as well makes theirs a
    no-op: after Step 4.147 all four printed the same corpus with and without
    `--keep-self`, which silently deleted the second framing each of them
    documents - `acpi-dep-census.py`'s "I2C/IC 55 nodes and 43 `{PEP0}` -> 58
    and 46" is the difference, and it is exactly what a no-op stops printing.
    So the filter is this module's default and is opt-out for a caller that
    has its own. Corrected in Step 4.148.
