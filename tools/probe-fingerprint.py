"""Which P2 instruments are inside an image, decided by content.

This exists because of one number that is a lie: **every payload built for this
phase is 1,142,784 bytes.** Measured 2026-09-24 on the three payloads of record -

    work/out/boot-now-0923.img                  1,142,784   sha256 3547fd04...
    work/out/p2-4.20/Mu-gauguin-silicon-gzip.img 1,142,784   sha256 dbf131d2...
    work/out/p2-variants/Mu-gauguin-silicon-gzip.img 1,142,784  sha256 7c8fdb5a...

- so a size is not evidence, and neither is a filename: two of the three are called
`Mu-gauguin-silicon-gzip.img`, and step 4.30 already recorded a control image that
"stopped being the bytes it named without the name changing". What separates them
is a handful of `DEBUG` format strings inside `DxeCore`, and which of those are
present decides what the panel *can* print. That is the question this tool
answers, and it answers it the same way for a payload and for a readback of
`boot`, because both are Android boot images with the same payload shape.

The third line of that table is itself an instance of the rule, and the tidy-up
step 4.98 owed: `work/out/p2-variants/Mu-gauguin-silicon-gzip.img` no longer hashes
`7c8fdb5a...`. It is the 4.74 set now, **`90b21643...`**, still 1,142,784 bytes, same
name. The table is kept as measured on that date rather than refreshed, because the
point it makes is about the date it was measured on; what a reader wants is the
command, not a number that ages.

The three images are a ladder, and the ladder is the point. It has fourteen rungs
since step 4.98 added four; the values below are what `probe-fingerprint.py IMG`
prints now, not a column someone typed:

    boot-now-0923   FREE SEQ DIAG STATS WALK NOLOAD                        6/14
    preread-0923d   the same six, plus WHY                                 7/14
    p2-4.20         the first six, plus APRI WHY ERR BIN RETRY            11/14
    p2-variants     all fourteen                                         14/14
    p2-4.94         all fourteen                                         14/14
    p2-freewhy      all fourteen, P2 FWHY in the older spelling          14/14

`preread-0923d` is the rung the four-rung version of this table left out, and it is
the one that cannot be inferred from its neighbours: it is step 4.13's build, kept
under the name that means "the image that was on the phone before the next one", and
the record's own chain of payloads on `boot` puts it there from 4.13 until 4.25. It
is the only image that carries `P2 WHY` and not `P2 ERR`, so it is the only rung
where a panel showing a `WHY` line beside `SEQ` and no `ERR` below it is that build
rather than a stalled run - and the "a panel with no `P2 ERR` is running
`boot-now-0923`" gate two hundred lines down is exactly the inference this rung
bounds. Measured 2026-09-27 with `probe-fingerprint.py IMG`.

**`P2 WHY` and `P2 ERR` are why the ladder grew past six rungs, and they are the two
rows that decide whether a reading is even possible.** `boot-now-0923`
prints a `P2 SEQ` line and no `WHY` beside it and no `ERR` below it, because
`P2WhyLetter`/`P2MarkSeq` and the grouped `P2 ERR %r x%d` were added together, after
that payload was built. `P2 SEQ` has been read off this panel three times and
`P2 WHY` has been read zero times, which is exactly what a ladder whose oldest rung
prints SEQ alone predicts. What that costs is the whole reading: `SEQ` is a string of
`s` and `L`, and `L` means only *the load failed* - it names no status. `WHY` is the
same positions with the status class in each one, and `P2 ERR` is those statuses
again **grouped and counted**, which makes one short line - `P2 ERR Out of
Resources x27`, or three lines if the causes differ - the complete answer to "did the
batch fail for one reason or twenty-seven".

**But the older spelling of that sentence was too strong, and step 4.98 is the step
that measured it.** `boot-now-0923` does carry a row that names a status in words:
`P2 DIAG %c %g %r`, one row per failure, `L <guid> Out of Resources`. What it lacks
is `P2 WHY`, the *position table* that would let a reader index the `SEQ` string. So
the corrected form of the claim is narrower and more useful:

    **A panel showing `P2 SEQ` with no `P2 WHY` anywhere on it is running
    `boot-now-0923`, and the `SEQ` string's positions cannot be resolved from that
    screen - but its `P2 DIAG` rows name the failing status in words anyway, and
    they are the rows one line below the `SEQ`.** `--expect P2ErrRow` is still the
    gate that makes the next flash worth making; `--rows` is the gate that says
    whether a payload prints `P2 DIAG` at all.

The distinction is not pedantry, it is the difference between "read more carefully"
and "build a new payload". `P2 DIAG` is not a rung of this ladder because a rung is
an *instrument* - a function a build either has or has not - and `P2Digest` owns
fifteen rows and is named by one of them. Step 4.97 read a rung report as an
inventory of everything a payload can print, and paid for it; `--rows` below is the
mode that answers the question it thought it was asking.

**`P2 FW` is the rung that is not Dispatcher.c's.** The other thirteen print from the
digest, which runs *after* the batch, so every one of them describes the heap the run
left behind. The question they were built to answer -
why a request byte for byte identical to one that succeeded a few milliseconds later
was refused - is about the heap *at the failure*, and the only place that state exists
is inside `FindFreePages`, at the instruction where the allocator gives up
(`Mem/Page.c`: `if (!PromoteMemoryResource ())`, the one place a failure becomes
terminal). So the record is taken there and printed by the digest, as two lines and
never more - rows are the scarce thing, and a third would cost the panel its second
copy. `P2 FWTY` is the terminal failures counted by memory type, which falsifies
cheaply the belief that all 27 asked for `EfiBootServicesCode`; `n` is the whole
count, so `n=0` is no terminal failure at all and `n` above zero with no second
line is terminal failures that were all smaller than four pages. `P2 FWHY` is the
first image-sized refusal and the map it was refused in: `t=`/`np=`/`a=` the
request, `big=` the largest free run the same search would have accepted, `raw=`
the largest run before the alignment clip, `free=` every conventional page left,
`c=` the descriptor count. `big` against the request decides whether a run existed
at all; `free` against `big` separates a full heap from a fragmented one; `raw`
against `big` says whether the alignment clip was the cost. **`n=0` in `P2 FWTY`,
beside 27 recorded `L`s, is also an answer** - it puts the failure outside the page
allocator entirely, in `CoreLoadPeImage`'s own `AllocateRuntimePool`.

**`P2 KEY` is what makes the bottom row of the panel readable, and it is in exactly
one of the three.** `P2Digest` calls `P2Bins()` and then `P2Key()` last
(`Dispatcher.c:2464` and `:2470`, with the comment above the second one saying so),
and `P2Key`
prints one of two lines unconditionally - so on the newest build the last populated
row of the panel is *always* the `KEY` line, in every state, including after a
wipe. On `p2-4.20` there is no `P2Key`, so the last populated row is the `P2 RETRY`
line instead: that is step 4.29's reading, and it is not a contradiction of
`tools/console-budget.py`'s "the last populated row is the KEY line" - the two are
describing two different builds.

Which gives the categorical discriminator this tool was written for:

    **A `P2 RETRY` row as the last populated row of the panel means the payload
    on the phone is the `p2-4.20`-class build - the flash did not take the newest
    one.** On the newest build that row is followed by `P2Key` with nothing in
    between, so it cannot be the last row of a run that got that far.

So the markers are read out of the sources rather than typed here. That is not
tidiness: the first draft of this tool carried a hand-typed `err=%a at=%d` for
`P2Key`, the real format is `err=%r at=%d` (`Dispatcher.c:286`), and the tool
therefore
reported `P2Key` absent from an image that has it. A tool whose job is to tell
which instrument is in an image cannot invent its own fingerprints; it reads them,
and it fails loudly if the function it names no longer contains the line it
expects.

Usage:
    tools/probe-fingerprint.py IMG...                    # the ladder, per image
    tools/probe-fingerprint.py --rows IMG...             # every P2 row, not just rungs
    tools/probe-fingerprint.py --expect P2Key IMG        # pre-flight gate, exit 1
    tools/probe-fingerprint.py --read                    # dd `boot` first (TWRP)
    tools/probe-fingerprint.py --markers                 # what the names mean

`--expect` is the use this is for before a flash: it is the check that the payload
being written is one whose screen the reader can actually decode. It costs nothing
and it is the check that a size comparison silently passes.

`--rows` exists because `--expect` was once mistaken for an inventory of everything
a payload can print. It is not: it names instruments, and an instrument may own
many rows. Step 4.98 measured the difference - `boot-now-0923` reports `6 of 14` on
the ladder and prints 8 of the 27 rows the sources contain, and among the eight is
`P2 DIAG`, the only row in the block that names a failing status in words.

Exit status is 0 when every named instrument is resolved and every `--expect` holds;
1 when an `--expect` fails, when an image cannot be walked, or when a marker no
longer resolves in the source.

# The rungs above were ten until step 4.98, and the four that were added then are
# the four whose absence caused that step's error. They are a different kind of
# entry from the other ten: `P2 DIAG`, `P2 STATS` and `P2 WALK` are *rows of
# P2Digest*, not functions, and they were skipped because the ladder was read as an
# inventory of what a payload can print. It is not - it is a list of instruments,
# and `P2Digest` deliberately names only one of its own rows (`P2 FREE largest=`)
# because a function is the unit a build either has or has not. The consequence was
# measured: `boot-now-0923` was reported "2 of 10" and read as a payload with almost
# nothing to say, when its `DxeCore` carries eight `P2 ` rows - and the row one line
# below the `SEQ` string it has been transcribed for is `P2 DIAG L <guid> <status>`,
# the only row anywhere on this panel that names a failing status in words. `--rows`
# below is the mode that answers the question the ladder was mistaken for.
#
# `P2 NOLOAD` is a rung and not a `P2Digest` row: it is
# `CoreDisplayDiscoveredNotDispatched`'s, printed at `:2512` and `:2522`, *before*
# the digest's first call at `:2552`. That order matters to a reader - the digest is
# repeated forty-one times so that the panel ends up holding nothing but copies of
# it, and the six NOLOAD rows are printed once and then wiped.

# The ladder, in the order the rows appear on the panel. The three payloads of record
# were built before `P2FreeWhy` existed, so its column is 'no' for all three. It is
# built now, in `work/out/p2-freewhy` and `work/out/p2-freewhy-g`, which are the first
# two rungs of the ladder to carry all ten of the original instruments - and the first
# two that need the head markers in `resolve_markers()`, since the second build's
# `P2 FWHY` literal is not the first's. `P2 FW` is what a build has to carry before the
# free map at the failure is worth a flash: see docs/08-device-session.md, step 4.18
# onward. The four rungs added above in step 4.98 predate all three payloads of record,

    compiles its literal unconditionally on this platform - `PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel`

    catch.

    `line` is the line of the opening brace, which is the number a reader gets
    from `grep -n '^\s*DEBUG'` on the literal's own line only after adding the
    newlines between. Pointing it at the `Name (` line instead would be off by
    the two or three lines of the parameter list, which is exactly the kind of
    citation drift step 4.98 had to correct by hand.

    The guard that keeps a multi-line *call* from being taken for a definition is
    the semicolon: a definition's parameter list is followed by `)` and then `{`,
    a call's by `)` and then `;`. Without it `Foo (\n  arg\n  );` matches the same
    regex as `Foo (\n  VOID\n  )` and the brace that follows belongs to whatever
    is defined next.
