"""Which scan prefix produces which a-priori batch, and what each one implies.

Why this exists: the recorder prints `P2 WALK t=0 seen=<n> iter=<n+1>` for the
DRIVER pass and `P2 SEQ` with one character per entry the promotion loop
*matched*, so `len(P2 SEQ)` is `mP2Apriori`. The panel's SEQ is 46 characters,
so the batch was 46 - and on this volume more than one `seen` produces 46,
because the two orders are independent: the walk fills `mDiscoveredList` in
**physical** order and the promotion loop reads the Apriori array in **Apriori**
order (`Dispatcher.c:2104-2125` is an outer loop over the array and an inner
loop over the discovered list). So the batch is a function of the scan prefix
and of nothing else, and this tool tabulates that function instead of arguing
about it.

The number that matters is not 46 by itself but *which* 46: a scan that reached
80 DRIVER files promotes a contiguous run of the array, while a scan cut at 48
or 49 promotes a scattered set that includes the four console drivers - whose
files sit low in the volume and late in the array. The two batches share 42
entries and differ in eight, so `P2 DIAG`'s GUID list separates them outright,
and this tool prints both lists for comparison against a photograph.

The "reached 80" candidate needs its premise stated, because no array on this
disk supports it: every archived payload's array is 70 entries with entry 0 the
core file and 1..69 all present `DRIVER`s, so a scan that reached the end of
*this* volume promotes **69**, and a 46-character line is a scan that stopped
(`docs/08` step 4.130). The contiguous `ap1..ap46` batch is what a complete scan
gives when the array was read 368 bytes short at run time - the `entries=47`
reading - which is why the census below is the truncated-array reading and the
cut is the whole-array one, and why the row that decides between them is `P2
APRI` and not any letter string.

The letters (`s`, `L`) cannot separate them and no reading of them ever will.
Each character is the load result of the driver in that slot, and the slots are
the hypothesis under test - so a string of the right length is consistent with
*every* batch of that length, and any test that indexes the observed string by
a slot map has assumed the answer. That is worth printing because
`tools/fv-census.py`'s closing block does exactly that and reports the only two
candidates REFUTED for it (see `--letters` below, which reproduces the
comparison and says what it is worth).

The scope of that claim, added after step 4.142's correction was itself
corrected: it holds for a slot map that is a *hypothesis*, and the map this
tool's own table fixes is not one. Only `seen` values 48 and 49 give 46
promotions, and they give the *same* 46 entries - the array is 70 entries with
entry 0 the core file and the other 69 all present, so a promoted set is fixed
by the prefix alone and the letters can be read through it. What the letters
still cannot do is *choose* between two candidate batches, which is what
`--letters` tests and what `tools/fv-census.py`'s closing block got wrong in
the other direction.
