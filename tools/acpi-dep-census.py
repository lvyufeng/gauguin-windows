"""Count what the reference tables put in a `_DEP`, reproducibly.

`tools/acpi/gauguin.asl` writes seven `_DEP`s and its comments state the
corpus's behaviour as numbers: how many engine nodes of each protocol exist,
how many write `{PEP0}` and nothing else, how many name a GPI DMA controller,
how many name an SMMU; and, for the two nodes whose entry was a split, which
`_HID`s fall on which side. Those numbers were first measured with a throwaway
script in `/tmp`, and a throwaway script is how a number stops being
reproducible - the rule this repository states in `acpi-hid-census.disassemble`'s
docstring is that a number a reader cannot ask again from the repository is not
a measurement. Step 4.94 is what came of running the same questions again from
here: the first reading had counted this table as part of the family it was
measuring, so every one of its totals moved by this table's own contribution,
and the two statements that disagreed inside the same comment - "43 of 53" in
the table and "52 of the 53" in the prose above it - were the same mistake seen
twice.

The unit is the **node**, attributed by a single brace-stack pass over the
disassembly, and a node's `_DEP` is the declaration the walk finds directly
inside it rather than the first `Name (_DEP` anywhere after its header. That
distinction matters here for the same reason it does in
`tools/acpi-usb-pair-census.py`: a table that nests one device inside another
would otherwise attribute the inner node's dependency to the outer one, and the
count would be right by accident on this corpus and wrong on the next.

The corpus can contain *this* table - it is a Mu-Silicium checkout's
`Silicium-ACPI` submodule and `tools/sync-uefi-platform.sh` installs ours into
it - and a census of the family that includes the file being written is not a
census. It is therefore left out by default, the same rule and default as
`tools/acpi-order-votes.py` and `tools/acpi-usb-pair-census.py`, and
`--keep-self` prints the other framing. Both are printed when they differ,
because the difference is this table's own contribution.

# produce different packages here: all 451 `Method (_DEP)` bodies in the 65
# reference tables are a `Return (Package (0x01) { ... })` and nothing else, so
# for the question these columns ask - which name does this node depend on -
# `Method` and `Name` are the same answer written twice.

# This comment said the opposite until Step 4.94: that a `Method` form "is not a

# the corpus it is about. That is the same fault the step was written to fix, so
